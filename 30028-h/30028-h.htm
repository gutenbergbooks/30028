<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>
<p>The Pacific Express was due at Valley City at 1:45 p.m.
Within ten minutes of that time, a spring-board
wagon, containing two young men and drawn by a pair
of bronchos, suddenly appeared around one end of the
dingy little depot. One of the men, dressed in a tweed
traveling suit, jumped hastily from the wagon, while the
other, who looked like a prosperous young ranchman,
seemed to have all he could attend to in holding the restive
little ponies, who were rearing and kicking in their
impatience at being compelled to stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Ned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll have to look
out for your traps yourself; these little rats haven&rsquo;t been
driven for four days, and they&rsquo;re feeling pretty frisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; responded the other, diving under
the seat of the spring-board and bringing out the said
&ldquo;traps,&rdquo; which consisted of two grips, a rifle case, a set of
fishing rods, and, last but not least, a large, square case
which he handled with great care, and now held up to
his companion saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that, Tom? that&rsquo;s my set of cameras; they&rsquo;re
fine too, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you bother to take them around with you
all the time, like that?&rdquo; inquired his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Ned, &ldquo;I do that so as to be ready to catch
any choice scenes I come across; I&rsquo;m making a collection
of views, you know, and I expect to get a good many on
this trip. By the way, I got some stunning views over
there at your place this morning, just before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens, you did!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, suddenly remembering
a ludicrous predicament in which his guest
had caught him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;and when I get away at a safe
distance I&rsquo;m going to develop them and send them to
you. I&rsquo;ve got an awfully fine&ndash;&ndash;well, by Jove, if that isn&rsquo;t
just my luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned had just deposited his belongings on the depot
platform and in doing so, noticed a piece of blackboard
propped up against the wall, on which were chalked these
words, &ldquo;Train 3 ours late.&rdquo; His eyes seemed riveted to
the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked Tom, who took in the
situation at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter! Why, that blasted train is three hours behind
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; said Tom, with a grin; &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d only known
that I needn&rsquo;t have driven my horses so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, confound those little beasts of yours;&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned, &ldquo;a little exercise won&rsquo;t hurt them, but to think of
three hours in a place like this! and say, don&rsquo;t you know
how to spell out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, coolly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold myself personally
responsible for the wording of that blackboard,
but I suppose that&rsquo;s the phonetic spelling they used to talk
about when I lived east; you see we&rsquo;ve adopted it out
here, for we westerners have to rustle lively, and don&rsquo;t
have time for old-fashioned ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ned, rather sarcastically; &ldquo;perhaps you
can tell me why they don&rsquo;t &lsquo;rustle&rsquo; that train along on
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s on account of that
wreck two days ago; you know your train was ten hours
late yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Ned, gazing about him with an expression
of intense disgust; &ldquo;I got here after dark; that&rsquo;s
how it comes about that I never realized until the present
moment what a paradise this place is. Valley City!
I can&rsquo;t see more than a dozen buildings here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re so near-sighted, my
dear boy,&rdquo; replied Tom; and Ned, who was very sensitive
on the subject of his near-sightedness, colored, and readjusted
his eye-glasses, while he asked in a tone of despair:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what am I to do in this beastly place, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might take a stroll about the city,&rdquo; suggested
Tom, &ldquo;if you get lost you&rsquo;ll have to inquire your way of
some of the police. I would be delighted to stay and
keep you company, but work on the ranch is rushing and
I must hurry back; so I&rsquo;ll wish you good luck and good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; said Ned, shaking hands in a
slightly patronizing way, &ldquo;if you ever get out of this
country, and find yourself within the limits of civilization
again, just take a run down to the &lsquo;Hub&rsquo; and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said Tom, turning around for a parting
shot; &ldquo;I say, Ned, while you&rsquo;re waiting for the train,
you&rsquo;d better get out your cameras; you might catch some
more &lsquo;stunning views&rsquo; you know,&rdquo; and lightly snapping
his whip, he started off, the bronchos standing on their
forefeet with their heels in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Tom,&rdquo; Ned called, after the rapidly retreating
spring-board, &ldquo;if you ever had any brains to lose I&rsquo;d
be anxious about you, but I guess you&rsquo;re safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s only reply was a crack of the whip, and he and
the ponies soon disappeared in a cloud of dust, leaving
Ned to survey his surroundings at his leisure.</p>
<p>In the foreground was the low, dingy depot, and on the
platform, leaning against the building as though their
spinal columns were unable to support them, were two
specimens of the genus homo, which were entirely new
to the young Bostonian. He gazed at them with undisguised
interest, being unable to determine whether they
were cow-boys or miners, these being the two classes into
which, as he imagined, the western population was about
evenly divided. That they immediately classified him, in
their western vernacular, as a &ldquo;tenderfoot,&rdquo; and a remarkably
verdant specimen at that, was not owing to their
superior penetration, as it was a self-evident fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Edward B. Rutherford, Jr., prided himself upon being
a resident of Boston, a son of one of her best families,
and a graduate of Harvard, and it is scarcely to be wondered
at if he felt himself slightly superior to ordinary
mortals who had not been blessed with these advantages.
Nevertheless, the fact remained that Mr. Rutherford&rsquo;s personal
appearance could not be considered especially prepossessing,
even when moving in his own sphere where
he felt himself, as he would have expressed it, &ldquo;en rapport&rdquo;
with his surroundings; under other circumstances,
as at the present time, it very nearly approached the
ludicrous. He was small in stature, but his bump of self-esteem
was developed in an inverse ratio to his size. He
seemed to be making a constant effort to maintain his
dignity at the proper level, in which direction he was
greatly assisted by a pair of eye-glasses, perched on a
very large and decidedly Roman nose. It had been
claimed by his college chums that the eye-glasses were
worn for this especial purpose; be that as it may, without
their assistance, his task would certainly have been a
difficult one, as his eyes, which were very full and round,
and surmounted by a pair of extremely high-arched eyebrows,
gave him always an expression of exaggerated
surprise and bewilderment, which, when intensified as
on the present occasion, rendered his appearance very far
from the otium cum dignitate to which he aspired. But
upon very few is the &ldquo;giftie&rdquo; bestowed, &ldquo;to see oursel&rsquo;s
as ithers see us,&rdquo; and to many besides the junior Mr.
Rutherford, such a vision would be anything but satisfactory.</p>
<p>At the present time, however, Rutherford&rsquo;s only troubles
were his immediate surroundings, and the problem
of how to pass the next three hours. The loungers, who
by this time had changed to a sitting posture, and who
were staring at him with an unwinking fixedness which
made him rather nervous, did not seem very congenial
companions. The town consisted of merely a few, straggling,
unpainted buildings, while in every direction extended
the apparently interminable stretches of undulating
prairie, partially covered with sage brush and wild
cactus. Though early in the season, the heat was intense,
and the glare of the sunlight reflected from the patches
of white, chalk-like sand, was so blinding as to seem unendurable.</p>
<p>The interior of the depot was even more cheerless than
the exterior. A rusty stove, minus one leg, two or three
battered benches, a flaming circus poster, and an announcement
of the preceding year&rsquo;s county fair constituted
the entire furnishing and decoration. No signs
of life were visible, the window into the ticket office being
closed, while from somewhere within the little inclosure,
a telegraphic instrument clicked with a cheerful
pertinacity that to Rutherford seemed simply exasperating.</p>
<p>In the course of half an hour, however, the monotony
was relieved by the appearance of half a dozen soldiers,
who strolled over from a neighboring fort, about two
miles distant. Rutherford had soon introduced himself
to them, with a formality which they considered highly
amusing, and they entertained him with tales of various
thrilling adventures and hair breadth escapes, nearly all
invented for the occasion, to which he listened with an
open-mouthed astonishment that elicited many winks
and grins from the blue-coats. Finally, two of them
escorted him to a small Indian camp, about a mile distant,
which was hidden from view by a sandy knoll,
where, in some cottonwood brush, beside a small creek,
they found half a dozen tepees, around which were
squatted twenty or thirty disreputable-looking Indians,
their ponies tethered in the brush near by. The bucks
were sullen and uncommunicative, maintaining a solemn
silence broken only by an occasional grunt. Their
dress was a combination of Indian costume and articles
purchased from the white people, the latter being put
on to suit the individual taste of the wearer, without
the least regard to the use for which it was originally
intended. One, who seemed a leader in the camp, in
addition to his native toggery of feathers, beads and
brass rings, wore trousers of striped bed-ticking, two
or three pairs of gayly colored suspenders knotted together
for a belt and sash, and a flaming red necktie
braided in his hair. The squaws in their blankets were
quite socially inclined, and the wig-wams at a little distance
looked very romantic to the young easterner, but
the odors wafted from them were sufficient for him, and
he declined to penetrate any further into the mysteries
of an Indian camp; and after taking one or two views
of the Indians and their tepees, he returned to the
depot.</p>
<p>It was now nearly train time, and the number of
loungers and loafers had increased amazingly, considering
the size of the town. There were thirty or forty of
them, all more or less resembling the first specimens,
and Rutherford wondered where they stowed themselves
away, not realizing that many came in from little shacks
scattered over the prairies; for to them, the coming of
the train from the east was the one great event of the
day.</p>
<p>Among them Rutherford noticed a man, who, though
clad as roughly as the others, yet had an individuality
so distinct from them as to be noticeable even to a stranger.
He wore an old soft hat and rough blouse, his
trousers being tucked into a pair of heavy, hobnailed
boots that reached to his knees. He was tall and stooped
slightly, but there was none of the slouching figure and
gait that characterized those around him. His movements
were quick, and, when standing motionless, there
was something in his very pose that conveyed an impression
of alertness and of latent strength. His back
was turned toward Rutherford, who was watching him
under a sort of subtle fascination, when suddenly he
wheeled, facing him. His eyes were keen and piercing,
and as he looked for an instant at Rutherford with an
expression of suspicion and distrust, and then seemed
to survey his diminutive figure with a quick glance of
contempt, that young man felt a sudden and violent
terror in his inmost soul, which was not lessened when
his eyes fell upon a sheath knife and huge revolver in
the stranger&rsquo;s belt. Involuntarily Rutherford&rsquo;s hand
went to his hip pocket, where reposed a dainty, pearl-handled
Smith and Wesson, 38-calibre, but he immediately
regretted the movement, for the blue-black eyes
watching him scintillated for a moment with a cold, steel-like
glitter, and the lips under the heavy, black beard
curled with a smile of fine scorn, that made our young
hero exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The whistle of the approaching train afforded him
unspeakable relief, and at the first opportunity he put
himself and his belongings aboard with a celerity very
remarkable in one of his usual dignity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>
<p>As the Pacific Express was speeding westward across
the prairies, a young man, half reclining among the
cushions of the smoking car, was enjoying a choice
Havana. He took no note of external objects as they
flashed with almost lightning rapidity past the car windows,
and he seemed equally unconscious of the presence
of his fellow passengers. His dress and manner, as well
as his nonchalant, graceful attitude, and even the delicate
poise of his cigar, were all indicative of wealth and
refinement, and of a courtesy innate, not acquired. His
head was slightly thrown back, and with half-closed,
dreamy eyes, he watched the coils of blue smoke wreathing
and curling above his head, but his mind was actively
engaged in planning the details of the new life opening
up before him in the west. Walter Everard Houston,
of New York, the possessor of a million in his own
name, and prospective heir to many millions more, was
en route for a small mining camp, far west, in the heart
of the Rockies, where he was to fill the position of bookkeeper
and corresponding secretary in the office of a
mining company, at a salary of one hundred dollars per
month.</p>
<p>Mr. Houston&rsquo;s parents had died when he was very
young, and he had been tenderly reared in the home of
his uncle, his mother&rsquo;s brother, Walter Everard Cameron.
Even now, as he watched the blue coils above his
head, his memory was going back to the time
when he had entered that beautiful home. He recalled
the different members of that lovely family, as they then
appeared to him; the dark, patrician face of his aunt,
with its wondrous beauty, which, in the following years
had been so softened and deepened by sorrow that now
it was almost saint-like in the calm look of peace and
love which it wore, with the soft, snow-white hair surrounding
it like a halo of glory. Then his beautiful
cousin Edna, with her sunny hair and starry eyes, and
her wonderful voice filling the home with music. She
had married soon after he entered the family, and went
with her husband to a distant, western city, often returning
to visit the old home. How well he remembered the
last visit! Her baby was then nearly two years old; he
could not now recall her name, but she was a little, golden-haired
toddler, with her mother&rsquo;s eyes and voice. His
cousin was suddenly called home by a telegram that her
husband was ill; then, in a day or two, came the news
of a frightful railroad accident, a collision and a fire
which quickly consumed the wreck. Edna was rescued
from the flames, unconscious and dying, but no trace
could be found of the little one. Then followed word of
the death of Edna&rsquo;s husband; he had died a few hours
later than the accident occurred, ignorant of the terrible
fate of his wife and child.</p>
<p>Next came the memory of his cousin, Guy Cameron,
but a few years older than himself; dark and beautiful
like his mother, proud spirited and headstrong, the pride
of his parents, but through him came their most bitter
sorrow. Through fast living and gambling he became
deeply involved, and forged his father&rsquo;s name to several
checks, amounting to nearly a hundred thousand; then,
overcome by shame and remorse, he had fled in the
night, no one knew whither. His father payed the full
amount of the debt, without even betraying his son&rsquo;s
guilt, and then for years employed the most skillful detectives,
trying to bring back the wanderer to the love
and forgiveness which awaited him; but in vain, no
trace of him existed. The father had long ago given up
all hope of ever seeing his boy again, and doubted whether
he were living. Only the sweet-faced mother, strong
in her mother-love and in her faith in God, believed that
he would yet return, and was content to watch and wait.</p>
<p>Meantime, Everard Houston had become like a son
to Mr. and Mrs. Cameron. After leaving college, he had
been taken by his uncle as a partner into his enormous
banking house, and intrusted more or less with the
charge of various departments of business with which he
was connected, and he had proven himself worthy of the
trust reposed in him.</p>
<p>For a number of years, Mr. Cameron had been president
of a large investment company, which, among other
properties, owned a number of mines in the west which
had been represented to be very valuable, and which, at
the time of purchase, possessed every indication of being
heavy producers of very rich ore. Lately, these mines
had not been yielding the profit which it was reasonable
to expect from them, and there were indications of bad
management, if not of dishonesty, at the western end of
the line. One or two so-called experts had been sent
out to investigate, but they had after all so little knowledge
of practical mining, that they were unable to produce
any tangible evidence against the company who
constituted their western agents, although their reports
had only tended to strengthen Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s belief
that there was underhanded and dishonest dealing somewhere,
which could only be detected by a person on the
ground whom the western company would not suspect
of being personally interested. Happening to learn,
through a Chicago firm who were friends of Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s,
that the western company were desirous of getting
a bookkeeper and confidential clerk, it was decided,
after consultation, to send out Everard Houston to take
this position. Accordingly, he had gone to Chicago,
and the firm there had written a letter to the mining
company, recommending him as a young man of their
acquaintance, of exceptional ability, reliable, and thoroughly
to be trusted in all confidential matters. The
company had responded favorably, offering the position
to Mr. Houston for one month on trial, at one hundred
dollars, his traveling expenses to be paid by them. If he
proved satisfactory, they would retain him as long as
would be mutually agreeable, and if his services proved
as valuable as expected, would increase his salary. Mr.
Houston was, therefore, on his way to the mines to accept
this position, together with the munificent salary,
and hoped to prove so satisfactory as to soon be admitted
to the &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; clerkship, in which event he
anticipated being able to accomplish a nice little piece
of detective work.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_III' id='CHAPTER_III'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>
<p>Mr. Houston was aroused from his pleasant revery by
the rather noisy entrance of a young man, who, with
flushed face, and manner more indicative of self-assertion
than self-possession, passed down the car and took a seat
facing himself. This was none other than our friend,
Rutherford, who, having secured his berth in the sleeper,
and arranged his belongings to his entire satisfaction,
immediately repaired to the smoking car to soothe his
perturbed and agitated spirits by a cigar.</p>
<p>From under his heavily drooping eyelids, Houston regarded
his vis-a-vis with concealed amusement, for he
was an apt student of human nature, and possessed an
unusual degree of insight into the characteristics of those
with whom he was thrown in contact.</p>
<p>Rutherford, on his part, was watching Houston with
his usual degree of interest and curiosity. Each was
measuring the other from his own standpoint: Houston&rsquo;s
prompt decision was,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;A good-hearted fellow, but
something of a cad;&rdquo; while Rutherford&rsquo;s vague surmises,
summed up verbally, would have been,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Nice
looking sort of fellow, a gentleman; guess he&rsquo;s got the
stuff, too; &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do any harm to make his acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An opportunity for this soon presented itself, for as
the conductor passed leisurely through the car, examining
tickets, Rutherford discovered that their destinations
were the same, and hastily drawing his card case
from his pocket, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we seem likely to be fellow travelers for a while,
I should be pleased to make your acquaintance; allow
me,&rdquo; at the same time offering his card.</p>
<p>Houston took the card, greeting him courteously, and
giving his own in exchange. He half smiled as he
looked at the diminutive slip of cardboard with its Boston
address made unnecessarily prominent, while Rutherford,
after scanning the card he held, bearing simply
the name of W. E. Houston, remarked with a decidedly
upward inflection,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are from&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Chicago,&rdquo; Houston replied promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Rutherford responded, &ldquo;then I suppose you are
quite familiar with this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; replied Houston, smiling, &ldquo;Chicago,
I&rsquo;ll admit, seems inclined to embrace a small part
of the state of Illinois within her city limits, but I never
heard of her attempting to claim the prairies of the Missouri
valley among her suburbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Rutherford, laughing, &ldquo;not quite so
bad as that, I guess, but perhaps I didn&rsquo;t convey my
meaning very clearly; my idea was, that living in one
of the western cities, you know, perhaps you were out
this way often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, this is my first trip out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! A pleasure trip, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am out on business,&rdquo; replied Houston, not caring
to state very definitely just then the nature of his
business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rutherford, settling himself into an attitude
more comfortable than graceful, &ldquo;I came out on
a pleasure trip, but I must say that so far, the pleasure
has been rather an uncertain quantity; for the last forty-eight
hours, I haven&rsquo;t seen much besides dust, Indians
and desperadoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-eight hours!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion, &ldquo;you
surely have not been on this train that length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on this train; I stopped off last night to see an
old friend of mine that has a ranch out here,&rdquo; and forthwith,
Rutherford launched into a recital of his experiences
of the last few hours, not omitting a description
of the man whose appearance had struck such terror to
his heart and expedited his departure from Valley City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, he was a man I wouldn&rsquo;t like to meet in
the dark; he was armed to the teeth, and there was a
look in his eye that was awfully unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Houston judged from his companion&rsquo;s manner
that he had not been particularly pleased at meeting this
alleged desperado in broad daylight, but he courteously
refrained from any such insinuation, and as supper was
just then announced, the young men adjourned to the
dining car, and the experiences of Mr. Rutherford were,
for the time, forgotten.</p>
<p>Nothing special occurred that evening, except that
the monotony of the journey was slightly relieved by the
train entering upon the Bad Lands. For some time,
Houston and Rutherford stood upon the rear platform,
enjoying their cigars, and watching the strange phenomena
of that weird region; on all sides, vast tracts of
ashen gray or black, as if burnt to a crisp, with no sign
of life, animal or vegetable, the lurid lights flashing and
playing in the distance, until it seemed as though they
might be gliding through the borderland of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno.</p>
<p>Their cigars finished, they separated for the night, to
be agreeably surprised by the delightful change that met
their eyes the following morning. Houston was already
at the breakfast table enjoying the scenery, when Rutherford
sauntered into the dining car. They exchanged
greetings, and the latter dropped into a seat facing his
companion, exclaiming as he did so,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say now, this looks a little more like civilization,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and having ordered his breakfast and helped
himself to fruit, he proceeded to watch the beautiful
panorama flashing past in the sunlight.</p>
<p>They were passing through one of the most fertile
valleys of the northwest. Away to the south, a beautiful
river glistened like a broad ribbon of silver, and leading
from it was a gleaming net-work of irrigating canals and
ditches, carrying the life-giving waters over thousands
of broad acres; some already green with grass and alfalfa,
while others were dotted with scores of men and
horses opening the brown earth in long, straight lines
of furrows, or scattering broadcast the golden grain.</p>
<p>Far in the distance, faintly outlined against the blue
sky, was a fleecy, cloud-like mass, grayish blue at the
base, with points here and there of dazzling whiteness,
which Houston had known at once as the first glimpse
of the Rocky Mountains, but which Rutherford failed
to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter, withdrawing his head from the
window, and preparing to attack his breakfast, &ldquo;it seems
to me, after nearly forty hours of nothing but prairies,
it&rsquo;s about time to see some mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in sight now,&rdquo; responded Houston quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion, dropping his knife
and fork in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see them now; I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you
to recognize them,&rdquo; said Houston, smiling; &ldquo;look off
there to the southwest,&rdquo; he added, as Rutherford was readjusting
his eye-glasses, preparatory to a careful survey
of the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blessed!&rdquo; ejaculated the latter, &ldquo;I supposed
those were clouds. My! but they must be mighty
far away, twenty-five miles, I expect, at the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty miles, at least,&rdquo; said Houston, glancing at them,
&ldquo;perhaps more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said a bland voice across the
aisle, and the young men, turning, saw a much-bejewelled
individual, with a florid, but very smiling face; &ldquo;I
see you have not yet become accustomed to the vast distances
of this great country of ours in the northwest.
Those mountains which you are discussing are about
ninety miles distant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford&rsquo;s eyes expressed an immense amount of
incredulity, while Houston simply bowed silently. The
man continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wonderful rarity of our atmosphere in these altitudes
is something that has to be experienced in order
to be thoroughly understood and appreciated, or even
believed. You tell an eastern man of the great distances
here at which you can see and hear, clearly and readily;
he will immediately doubt your veracity, simply because
it is without the line of his experience. Now I myself,
personally, with my own, unaided vision, have been able
to count the mules in a pack-train sixty-three miles distant,
and have repeatedly held conversations at a distance
of fifteen miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess the conversation was pretty much all on one
side, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Rutherford, adding sotto voce to
Houston, &ldquo;as on the present occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, indeed not,&rdquo; the man replied; &ldquo;I see, my
young friend, that you are inclined, like all strangers, to
be a little incredulous and skeptical, but if you remain
in this country of ours any length of time, that will soon
pass away, very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care to remain here very long then,
if it will have any such effect on my brain as that,&rdquo; said
Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are inclined to be facetious, my friend; that is
all right, I appreciate a little witticism myself occasionally.
By the way,&rdquo; he continued, evidently determined to
get into conversation with Houston, &ldquo;I suppose you
young gentlemen are out here on business, looking for
valuable investments in this wonderful country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;Business&rdquo; Mr. Rutherford instantly assumed
his dignity, dropping into the slightly drawling
tone he always used on such occasions, and which he
intended as an extinguisher on any person whom he
deemed too familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he replied, twirling an incipient mustache,
&ldquo;at least, not so far as I am concerned; I am just out on
a sort of an extended pleasure trip, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, your friend is a business man, I judge; perhaps,&rdquo;
turning to Houston, &ldquo;we can interest you in some of our
rare bargains in the line of real estate, improved or unimproved,
city or country; or possibly in our mines,
gold or silver properties, quartz or placer, we have them
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have a &lsquo;corner&rsquo; on this part of the northwest?&rdquo;
remarked Rutherford, rather sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, young man, we have a good many &lsquo;corners,&rsquo;
pretty valuable ones, too,&rdquo; the man replied imperturbably,
still watching Houston, who replied in a courteous
but indifferent tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am out here on business, but am not in a position
to make any investments at present, nor do I expect to
be for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, your business?&rdquo; asked his interlocutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an accountant,&rdquo; he replied quietly.</p>
<p>The man seemed satisfied. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said,
rising from the table, &ldquo;I am glad to have met you, and
hope to have the pleasure of seeing you later in our city.
Allow me to present my card, and if there is anything we
can ever do for you in our line, please give us a call,&rdquo;
and smilingly handing each a card, he bowed himself out
of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Rutherford, his grammar
getting a little mixed, &ldquo;either that man&rsquo;s a fool, or he
thought we were; I don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the latter,&rdquo; said Houston, smiling; then
glancing at the card beside his plate, he read, &ldquo;J. D. Wilson,
President of the Northwestern Mining, Land and
Investment Company, Silver City;&rdquo; and he was the prospective
clerk of The Northwestern Mining, Land and
Investment Company!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>
<p>An hour or two later, the Pacific Express was slowly
winding up the long mountain grade, the engine puffing
and wheezing in apoplectic fashion, and occasionally
emitting short shrieks of protest. The mountains, which
had gradually been assuming shape and color, were now
looming up in grand proportions, their rugged outlines
clearly defined against the sky. Already the mountain
breezes, fragrant with the breath of tamarack, spruce
and pine, stole in on adventurous wings through the car
windows; lifted locks, both golden and silvered, from
heated brows, kissed a fretful infant into peaceful slumber,
turned the pages of novels and flapped newspapers
so persistently that their readers were compelled to abandon
them, and brought new energy and inspiration to
the languid, listless passengers, so that they began to
evince symptoms of interest in their surroundings.</p>
<p>In his favorite lounging attitude, Houston sat, his eyes
fixed on the mountains, moment by moment growing
more distinct in their rugged grandeur, a half-smile of
amusement playing over his face, as he recalled the interview
with the president of The Northwestern Mining,
Land and Investment Company. Upon inquiry, he had
learned that Mr. Wilson had boarded the train at a little
way station, before daylight that morning, and the
zeal displayed by that gentleman in thus seeking to ascertain
something regarding the characteristics of his
future clerk, by anticipating his arrival in this manner
seemed to Houston decidedly amusing, and at the same
time furnished him a clue concerning the character of
one of the men with whom he was to be associated.</p>
<p>He was aroused by the entrance of Rutherford, who,
having learned that the train would make stops among
the canyons they were approaching, was getting his
kodak and plates in readiness, preparatory to taking impressions
of some of the finest views.</p>
<p>After a few moments, the conversation drifted to the
subject of their destination, which they would reach in
three or four hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Rutherford, addressing his companion
rather hesitatingly, &ldquo;I suppose you will remain
in Silver City for some time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite certain,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;my impression
is, however, that I shall not be detained there more than
a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! then are you going on farther west?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I expect to go out among the mines for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the mines! Now I should think that would
be fine; you&rsquo;ll have a chance to see western life in earnest.
So you are interested in mines! Well, I thought
something of the kind when you said you were out on
business. No wonder you were so cool with old Boomerang
this morning, and didn&rsquo;t care for any of his wonderful
investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston was silent for a moment, a curious smile playing
over his fine features; then watching Rutherford
keenly through half-closed eyes, he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, instead of being a mine owner, as
you surmise, I am the employe of a mining company,
and &lsquo;old Boomerang,&rsquo; as you call him, is the president
of that company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford sat for an instant as if petrified; then managed
to gasp, &ldquo;Great Heavens! are you associated in
business with that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, looking almost as if he enjoyed
the situation, &ldquo;associated as employer and employe. I
am going out to fill the position of accountant for the
same company of which he is president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; you are just going to take the position.
Did you know all the time who he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no more idea than you until I saw his card;
but I think he knew me, was looking around, in fact, to
see what his new clerk was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old beast!&rdquo; exclaimed Rutherford. His face was
a study, it represented so many conflicting emotions;
several times he seemed about to speak, then remained
silent, looking more and more perplexed. He was sorely
puzzled; Houston was the embodiment of courtesy
and refinement, his every word and gesture revealed a
man of wealth, education and culture,&ndash;&ndash;and yet, a clerk,
and for such a man! and strangest of all, he seemed to
feel no chagrin in speaking of his position.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s voice broke in pleasantly upon his cogitations:
&ldquo;I saw it would never do for you to travel about
here under such erroneous impressions; imagining you
were associating with a heavy capitalist, or a mining
broker, when&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; interrupted Rutherford, brusquely,
&ldquo;What difference does it make? You&rsquo;re a gentleman,
anybody can see that. I&rsquo;ll own up that it did knock me
out at first to find you were connected in any way with
that old chap; but I know you&rsquo;re all right, and I had
no business questioning around as I did about your
affairs; I beg your pardon, and I&rsquo;ll explain now why I
did it. I&rsquo;m a stranger out here, and I&rsquo;ve taken an awful
liking to you, and when we get to Silver City, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d like to keep in with you until I get a little
accustomed to the ways out here; that is, if you&rsquo;ve
no objections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; responded Houston cordially, &ldquo;stay
with me as long as you like; and now, let&rsquo;s go out and
take a look at the mountains,&rdquo; and the two young men
shook hands, each feeling a sort of presentiment that the
friendship begun under these peculiar circumstances
was one for life, and such it proved.</p>
<p>On reaching the rear platform they discovered that
the train was following the course of a river winding
through a rocky gorge that grew narrower, moment by
moment. The walls grew higher and steeper at every
turn, while towering above and beyond were the mountain
peaks. They stood clinging to the railings, and
watching the rapidly changing scene, as the train
swerved and swept from one direction to another, following
the winding of the river.</p>
<p>Suddenly the walls shot upward almost perpendicularly
for hundreds of feet, shutting out the sunlight, leaving
nothing visible but a narrow strip of sky; and still
the great rocks came closer and closer, until little more
than the width of the car was left, and it seemed that in
a moment that must be crushed. The ponderous wheels
were slowly revolving over a trestle bridge of steel,
mortised into the rocks, while the deafening echoes reverberated
between the narrowing walls, and rippled the
surface of the river flowing deep and black below. Then
suddenly another swift, sharp turn, and they were out
in the dazzling sunshine, amidst a scene of untold beauty
and grandeur.</p>
<p>Here, at the entrance of the canyon, the train stopped,
giving the passengers an opportunity to alight and enjoy
the scenery. On all sides rose masses of rock, some
fashioned in wondrous beauty, others in forms weird
and fantastic; some gray and rugged, some tinted with
intermingling shades of color, and others sparkling in
the sunlight as though studded with gems innumerable.
Here and there were piles of rock, crimson and green
and golden, resembling the moss-grown, ivy-covered
castles of the olden time. Farther on were mountains
covered with heavy forests of pine, through which the
winds sighed and whispered mysteriously, while at their
feet the little streams lingered lovingly long enough to
catch the whispered secrets, and bear them away, laughing
and singing, on their journey toward the great sea.</p>
<p>The train moved slowly on to another canyon, more
grand in its awful solitude than the first, surrounded on
all sides by walls nearly a thousand feet in height. At
one side, a broad sheet of water, shimmering in the sunlight,
fell, like a bridal veil, down the precipitous rock,
with a deafening roar disappearing into unseen depths
below, while at the base of the canyon lay a lake of sapphire,
in whose calm, untroubled depths, rocks and
cascade and sky were mirrored in perfect beauty.</p>
<p>Slowly the train wound its way upward, until it paused
again near the summit of the range, on the &ldquo;divide,&rdquo; the
boundary line between the east and the west. There
were the serried ranks of the mountains, vast, solemn,
grand; and in that awful solitude, under the spell of that
eternal silence, a sense of the infinite hushed every
tongue, and each one stood with bated breath, as if on
holy ground. On every side the billowy ranges surged,
like the gigantic waves of a storm-tossed ocean suddenly
congealed to stone, while here and there, towered
mighty peaks, like huge sentinels, their brows seamed
with furrows plowed by the hand of the centuries, their
heads white with the snows of countless ages.</p>
<p>Here two tiny streams flowed side by side, then separated;
the one to start on its long journey toward the
old Atlantic, the other toward the Golden Gate, to mingle
its waters with those of the sunset sea.</p>
<p>Slowly the passengers returned to the train, stopping
on their way to gather the little wild flowers growing
between the loosened rocks,&ndash;&ndash;frail mountain children of
the sun and wind,&ndash;&ndash;to be preserved as souvenirs of the
&ldquo;divide.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_V' id='CHAPTER_V'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>
<p>Rutherford had so diligently improved the opportunities
afforded by the stopping of the train, in securing
views of some of the finest scenes, that when the divide
was reached, he had only two plates left. These he
quickly used, and then gave himself up to silent contemplation
and enjoyment of the beauty around him.
Very slowly and regretfully he and Houston followed
the example of the others, and turned toward the waiting
train, like them, picking the delicate wild flowers
and pressing them in their note books.</p>
<p>It was during the first of these stops, at the entrance to
the canyons, that Rutherford, hastily glancing up from
his work, saw, standing among the passengers, a little
in the background, the man whom he had last seen at
the Valley City depot. He was standing in the same
alert, watchful attitude, but the soft hat was drawn downward
over his face concealing his eyes, and the knife and
revolver were hidden by a rough jacket. He was not
then looking toward Rutherford, but was facing in another
direction, where Houston was strolling among the
rocks, and when, a few moments later, Houston sauntered
over to observe his work, Rutherford called his attention
to the man, but he was nearly hidden behind a
group of men, only a little of his figure being visible.
Later, when they were again seated in the car, descending
the western grade, Rutherford asked his companion
whether he had succeeded in getting a glimpse of the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;a glimpse and no more; once
or twice I was near him, but his face was turned the other
way. I passed him in taking the train, but I had only a
hurried glimpse of his face; it seemed to me that it was
a face of unusual intelligence for a man of that class, as
I should judge him to be a miner, but I did not think he
looked particularly dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see his eyes,&rdquo; said Rutherford, then inquired,
&ldquo;By the way, did you see the old mining chap
anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Houston, laughing, &ldquo;twice; once with
a townsite map spread out before him, talking real estate
to a couple of men, and again in the smoking car where
he was playing poker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see him out looking at the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, probably they have no interest for him, except
just so far as they contain gold mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked of the mountains, and Rutherford suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;I wish I could find some way of getting
out and camping right among the mountains themselves.
I don&rsquo;t care to stop in any little half-civilized western
town for any length of time, but if I could just go right
out into the heart of the mountains somewhere, and stay
for a few weeks, that would be an experience worth having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston smiled; &ldquo;How would you like a trip out into
the part of the country where I am going? As near as I
can make out, it is twenty-five miles from the nearest
town, just a rough mining camp, with very few people
aside from the miners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Rutherford, &ldquo;I think that would be
fine; anyhow, I&rsquo;ll try it if you have no objections; it
will be a change anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was decided that Rutherford should extend
his pleasure trip into the mining camp, and Houston
was pleased with the arrangement, for, notwithstanding
the work which he had planned, he expected to find
many lonely hours and monotonous days, little dreaming
of the interests that awaited him, or that he was entering
upon the most eventful portion of his life.</p>
<p>At about one o&rsquo;clock the train arrived at Silver City,
a town of about fifteen thousand inhabitants. The young
men, as they left the train, caught a glimpse of the indefatigable
Mr. Wilson as he was boarding a street car
in company with two intended victims which he had already
secured. They took a carriage, and as they were
whirled rapidly through the steep, narrow streets on
their way to the hotel, the little city seemed to them like
a thoroughly typical, western, mining town. The town
was surrounded by mountains, and prospect holes and
abandoned placer diggings could be seen in every direction,
while interspersed among the business blocks of
brick and stone, were tiny cabins, built of logs,&ndash;&ndash;all
relics of the earlier days when Silver City was but a
large mining camp.</p>
<p>After lunch, Houston started forth in search of the
city office of The Northwestern Mining, Land and Investment
Company, which he found without difficulty.
He was surprised to discover that business there was
conducted on something of a co-operative plan, as the
one large room in which he found himself constituted
the offices of some half-dozen mining and real estate
companies, and was occupied at the time by eight or
ten different men, each seated at his own desk, and separated
from his neighbors by a little wooden railing. A
broad aisle extended through the center of the room,
and at the farther end were two or three accountants&rsquo;
desks, two large safes and two typewriters.</p>
<p>The whole arrangement seemed to Houston extremely
crowded and confusing, but he afterward learned that
it had its advantages; as certain deeds, contracts and
leases could be so easily mislaid and lost; then too, it
had an effect upon the minds of some of their patrons
that was particularly desirable, as they usually left the
office in a state of such bewilderment, that they were
unable to tell with any degree of certainty, just which
one of the many high-sounding companies it was, with
which they had entered into agreement, and as the eight
or ten men were each connected in some way with all
of the companies, they all came in for a share of the
profits, no matter who was the victim.</p>
<p>Houston having inquired of a white-haired, benevolent-looking
individual at his right, for Mr. Wilson, was
politely directed to the third desk on the left-hand side.
Here he found Mr. Wilson, who greeted him effusively,
and introduced him to Mr. Blaisdell, the general manager
of the company. The secretary of the company
was, at that moment, doing duty in another part of the
room, as president of The North American Townsite &amp;
Irrigation Company, consequently Houston did not
meet him until later.</p>
<p>As Messrs. Wilson and Blaisdell were just then engaged
with a customer, they begged Mr. Houston to excuse
them for a few moments, which he did very willingly,
and thus was afforded an opportunity to observe
the two men closely. Mr. Blaisdell had rather a long
and narrow face, and what is called a &ldquo;sandy&rdquo; complexion;
his hair, face and small goatee (he wore no mustache)
were all of the same, light, indefinite color; his
eyes were small and pale blue, while his lips were thin
and tightly compressed. His face, when at rest, had a
sanctimonious expression which was sadly at variance
with the avaricious, grasping look which it instantly assumed
when animated. He said little, but Houston soon
discovered that he was in reality the head man of the
company, while Mr. Wilson was but the mouthpiece.</p>
<p>In the twenty or thirty minutes which elapsed before
these gentlemen could give Mr. Houston their undivided
attention, he obtained sufficient insight into their characters,
and enough of an inkling of their business methods,
to make him more determined than ever to unearth
their schemes, and doubly anxious to succeed in the role
which he had assumed.</p>
<p>As soon as they were at liberty, Mr. Wilson and the
general manager turned very smilingly toward their new
clerk, and after some questions regarding his business
qualifications and experience, all of which he answered
in a manner very satisfactory, they proceeded to give
him detailed instructions relating to his future duties in
the branch office, at the mining camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Wilson, &ldquo;you understand
that as you become accustomed to the business, greater
responsibility will devolve upon you; for the present,
you are to have charge of the books and our correspondence
from that point; and when you have sufficiently
familiarized yourself with the details of the business, we
shall expect you, in Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s absence, to take
charge of the office, to receive the reports of the different
superintendents and foremen of the mines, and if
necessary, to inspect the work at the mines yourself, occasionally,
in order to see that our instructions are being
carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston thought that this included quite a range of
work for an accountant, but as he was only too glad of
the opportunities which would thus be afforded him for
his own investigations, he raised no objections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Mr. Houston,&rdquo; added Mr. Blaisdell, very
deliberately, &ldquo;it is unnecessary to say that in a position
of this kind, we require the utmost secrecy on your part
regarding the affairs of the company. In giving you
this very responsible position, we repose great confidence
in you, and we expect you to prove yourself
worthy of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; chuckled Mr. Wilson, &ldquo;I should say, judging
by Mr. Houston&rsquo;s appearance on the train this morning,
he understands the art of preserving a golden silence
as well as any one I ever saw. It was all I could
do to get a dozen words out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell smiled in a way that Houston understood
he had received a full account of the meeting on
the train. There being little more to be said, Houston
inquired regarding accommodations at the camp, stating
that a young acquaintance of his wished to remain
in the mountains for a week or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he interested in mines?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Blaisdell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;he is the young man who
informed Mr. Wilson he was out on an extended pleasure
trip, and he imagines it would be great sport to be
out in a genuine mining camp for a while, as far from
civilization as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; responded Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;I was
only going to state that we allow no visitors through
the mines except those who are personally interested,
or who have intentions of becoming purchasers, but if
your friend merely wants to stop among the mountains
for the fun of the thing, why, he&rsquo;s welcome to stay all
summer for aught I care. As to accommodations, I
think we can fix you both very comfortably. There are
two boarding houses near the mines, for the miners, of
course you would not go there; but old Jim Maverick
and his wife run a boarding house about a quarter of a
mile from there that is very good, and is a sort of stopping
place for any tourists that find their way out there.
I stop there myself, and I know Maverick and his wife
are glad of all the boarders they can get. I believe they
already had a lady when I was there last week, a school
teacher or something of that sort, who had just come,
and I think you will find it very comfortable there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having learned that they would have to start for the
camp at eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning, Houston took
his leave, promising to be in readiness at that time. He
next visited a number of assay offices, where he learned
a good many valuable points regarding the different
classes of ore in that vicinity; then having purchased
two or three works on practical mining and mineralogy,
which he thought might be of assistance to him, he returned
to the hotel, where he entertained Rutherford until
dinner with an account of their trip to be taken on the
morrow and the accommodations that awaited them,
with the added attraction of the society of a solitary
school teacher, whom their imaginations already depicted
as of uncertain age, with short hair and spectacles.
Many were Rutherford&rsquo;s speculations concerning
this individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of the acquaintance of two specimens
of that class,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one was in the Catskill
Mountains; she had a geological fad, and went out every
morning with a little hammer, to hammer among the
rocks all day; the other was a botanist, and returned
every evening about covered with plants which she had
pulled up, root and branch; I wonder which of them
this one will resemble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>
<p>Nearly twenty-five miles from the nearest town, and
not a human being visible from the point of observation
occupied by Miss Gladden, as she slowly swung backward
and forward in her hammock under the pines, half
way up the mountain side; and the only sign of human
life was a faint, blue smoke curling upward among the
evergreens on one side, at the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>Directly at the foot of the mountain lay a small lake of
azure blue, at one end of which was a narrow bridge
crossing the stream which formed the outlet to the lake,
and from which a footpath wound in the direction of the
solitary house from which the smoke ascended. At the
other extremity of the lake, where the gulch narrowed
into a deep ravine, walled with irregular masses of gray
rock, a mountain stream came dashing down over the
ledges, forming a series of cascades, and with a final
leap plunged into the azure waters. It was a wild, solitary
place, and had there been another human being visible,
he doubtless would have been much astonished at the
sight of a young lady, dressed in the height of fashion,
lazily swinging to and fro, half way up the pine covered
mountain.</p>
<p>But for Miss Gladden the charm of the situation lay in
its solitude; she was tired of society, and, glad to free
herself for a while at least from its conventionalities, was
congratulating herself upon her good fortune in finding
this retreat, all unconscious that others were already
entering into her little world, soon to enter into her
heart and life.</p>
<p>As she swung dreamily under the pines she was
aroused by a clear, musical voice calling her name, and
turning, saw the lithe, slender form of Lyle Maverick,
the daughter of her host, rapidly approaching. Although
Miss Gladden had been but a few days among
the mountains, there already existed between her and
Lyle Maverick a mutual admiration, though each was,
as yet, unconscious of the admiration of the other.</p>
<p>Lyle secretly worshipped Miss Gladden as the most
beautiful being she had ever seen, nor was it strange, for
Leslie Gladden had all her life received the homage always
yielded to beauty, and from hearts far less susceptible
than that of this untutored child of the mountains;
but Lyle, notwithstanding her surroundings and her disadvantages,
was proud spirited, and did not proclaim her
admiration for the beautiful stranger. Miss Gladden,
on her part, admired the imperious mountain maid, as
the loveliest specimen of uncultured, untrained girlhood,
just blossoming into womanhood, that she had ever met.
She wondered how she came to be so unlike her surroundings,
and what would be the result if this wild
mountain flower could be transplanted to some more
favorable spot, there to receive the care and nurture bestowed
on so many far less beautiful. She had within
the last few days, led by a desire to know the proud,
shy girl, made a companion of her; this was a new experience
for Lyle, and was fast deepening her admiration
for Miss Gladden into confidence and regard.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden watched Lyle now, as she came up the
mountain path, as fleet of foot and graceful in every motion
as a deer, her head thrown proudly back, her wavy
hair rippling over her shoulders to her waist, and shining
in the sunlight like fine spun gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Gladden,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as, having
reached the group of pines, she threw herself carelessly
at the foot of one of them, &ldquo;the solitude and isolation
which you have prized so highly are to be invaded by
two new boarders of masculine gender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight frown gathered on Miss Gladden&rsquo;s face, at the
prospect of intruders thus encroaching upon the mountain
retreat which she was beginning to regard as hers
exclusively. Lyle, watching her, saw the frown, and
continued, her eyes dancing with mischief:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are city gentlemen, too, from the east; from
Chicago and from Boston, only think of the honor conferred
upon us! They have come from the land of
civilization and culture to the wild west, to see how we
barbarians live; at least that is the object of one of them
who is out on a pleasure trip, for that is usually the
meaning of western pleasure trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, are you not rather severe? They come for the
sake of the scenery, or as I have, for rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few for rest perhaps, but scenery? nonsense! Look
at the majority of your &lsquo;western stories,&rsquo; as they are
called; how much is there in them of scenery? A few
lines here and there, but pages devoted to descriptions
of western life with its ignorance and uncouthness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stories of western life usually contain a great
deal of originality and piquancy; that is why they are
popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Lyle dryly, &ldquo;but I have seen very little
originality in the life I have led here. It may seem
original to outsiders; it is monotonous enough to those
who live it, year after year. The scenery of the west is
grand, I love it, and if I could see it with such eyes as
yours, eyes accustomed to beauty in all its infinite kinds
and degrees, and with a mind cultivated, fed on the
choicest thought than can be culled not only from our
own country and in our own tongue, but from other
countries and in other tongues as well, I would appreciate
the beauty about me more keenly than I can now;
but I despise this life in which I have been reared, a life
of ignorance, coarseness, brutality and deceit. Here I
have lived for the past ten years, here I am likely to live
for ten, twenty years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were silent for a few moments, while Miss Gladden
watched the beautiful face, in this instance an index
of an equally beautiful soul, and she marveled more than
ever. At last she said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, dear, pardon me for asking such a question, but
you are an anomaly; how is it, living all these years as
you have, in these surroundings, that you have so good
an education? You have evidently read considerable,
and you converse well; you cannot be called ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the girl replied sadly, &ldquo;I am not quite so ignorant
as a stranger would think to see me, but I have
learned just enough to make me realize how little I do
know, and that little I have acquired by stealth. I could
read a very little when we came here from some small
town, somewhere in the east, I have forgotten where,
and I wanted to learn, but father forbade it; he said he
wouldn&rsquo;t have any of his children putting on airs, that
what was good enough for him would have to do for
them. He has always been severe with me, I suppose
he didn&rsquo;t want any girls, that&rsquo;s what mother says.
Mother was always as kind to me as she dared to be, but
she was afraid to help me to learn anything, and she
couldn&rsquo;t have taught me much anyway. I studied every
little bit of print I could come across, if it were nothing
more than a scrap of newspaper, I was so anxious to be
able to read. Then, when I was about twelve years old,
a little girl who stayed here one summer with her governess,
left some of her old, worn-out school books and
writing books. I hid them in my room as carefully as if
they had been diamonds, and pored over them every
chance I could get for the next year. About that time,
I got acquainted with one of the miners who had been
here a long time, a strange, silent man, who was very
different from the others, and who kept by himself. He
seemed to take a great liking to me, and I consider him
to-day the best friend that I have in the world. He
found out how I was studying and trying to learn, and
he helped me, for he had had a fine education. He
bought books for me, not only school books, but choice
books to read, stories, poems and plays, and he has
talked with me a great deal, and told me about places
and people and authors, and so has saved me from being
a total ignoramus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder
that you consider him your friend. Is he here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lyle, &ldquo;he has been away for a few
days, but he came back last night, and I went down to
his cabin to see him. He brought me some beautiful
books, but I keep them at his cabin most of the time,
so no one at the house will get hold of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he live alone?&rdquo; asked Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, an Irishman, who has a pretty good education,
lives with him most of the time; he is quite a musician
and is teaching me to play the violin. &lsquo;Mike&rsquo; they call
the Irishman, and my friend is &lsquo;Jack&rsquo;; the other miners
nicknamed him &lsquo;Lone Jack,&rsquo; but nobody, I suppose,
knows what their real names are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how interesting!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden.
&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you ever told me before? It sounds like
a story with a deep-laid plot, and a typical villain lurking
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plots enough, and villains enough, but
Jack is not one of them,&rdquo; quietly replied the girl, with a
curious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he let me come and see him?&rdquo; inquired Miss
Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might, if I asked him, but you would find him
very uncommunicative. He does not care for strangers.
He was telling me last night about a comical, dudish
looking fellow whom he saw on the train, and who got
off at Silver City, and he said he was coming up here
into the mountains in company with another young gentleman;
he thought I would be likely to see them, and I
think they are the new boarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, have you seen them?&rdquo; asked Miss Gladden, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Lyle, &ldquo;one of them, from my post of
observation behind the kitchen door, and he did appear
so ridiculous with his gold eye-glasses, looking as solemn
as an owl, and glancing around with that expression
of supercilious curiosity, as though he expected to
find us all wild Indians, or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that accounts for the little tirade against western
pleasure tourists I heard when you first came up. Evidently
the eye-glasses did not produce a very favorable
impression on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted Lyle, &ldquo;see him yourself, and see what
impressions you will receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;as it is nearly
dinner time, I would suggest that we adjourn to the
house, alleviate these pangs of hunger, take an observation
of the gold eye-glasses and report our impressions
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Lyle merrily, and the two began to
descend the mountain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Houston and Rutherford were promptly at the depot,
as agreed, to take the early morning train to the mines.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell met them with a great show of cordiality,
his thin lips contracted into a smile which was doubtless
intended to be very agreeable, but which produced a
sensation exactly the reverse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Rutherford began, with his peculiar drawl,
when he and Houston were seated together in the car,
with Mr. Blaisdell safely engaged in conversation at a
little distance, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m any more favorably
impressed with Mr. Buncombe, or whatever his name
is, than I was with old Boomerang yesterday. That fellow
looked like a silly, pompous, old fool, and this one
like a sly, old villain. I wish he&rsquo;d stop that confounded,
wolfish grin of his, it makes me feel uncomfortable, he
looks as if he knew he had his prey just dead easy, and
his chops were watering in anticipation. I say, old fellow,
I don&rsquo;t think much of this Buncombe-Boomerang
combination of yours, and I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m
along with you till we find out what sort of a trap we&rsquo;re
getting into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston smiled; Rutherford had expressed his own
opinion a great deal nearer than he cared to admit. He
had seen enough of the men with whom he was to be
associated to convince him that they were villains, cowardly
villains too, the very sort of men that would be
most desperate and dangerous when cornered; but he
was fast laying his plans, and now the only drawback
seemed that he would have no assistant, and he felt the
time would come when he would need one, and some
one familiar with mining. An expert from the east
would not do, he would be suspected; and a detective
would not possess the necessary information regarding
mining in general, and these mines in particular. At
times, a vague idea of taking Rutherford into his confidence
came into his mind, but he was not ready to do
this yet, if at all.</p>
<p>All this flashed through Houston&rsquo;s mind as Rutherford
made the above remark, and he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t apprehend any particular danger at present,
but I am glad you are with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question with me is,&rdquo; continued Rutherford,
&ldquo;how I&rsquo;ll amuse myself during your office hours in such
a region as this; I don&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;ll find a great many
congenial companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have forgotten the school teacher,&rdquo;
Houston remarked, with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the school ma&rsquo;am! I had forgotten her.
I suppose she&rsquo;ll be as graceful as a scalene triangle, and
about as entertaining as a mummy. They&rsquo;re mostly that
kind, or else the gushing, adoring sort, that can&rsquo;t talk
of anything but Browning, or Emerson, or theosophy,
or something of that kind; and the most conceited lot
of creatures that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the train wound in and out among the
mountains, stopping for a few moments at a small town
where huge smelters were pouring forth their clouds of
dense smoke, darkening the air until it seemed more
like night than day; then on a few miles farther, to the
little station known as the &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; so-called on account of
the form of the spur tracks owned by the mining company,
by which the ore was brought down from the
mines above.</p>
<p>At the station was a store containing general mining
supplies, with the post-office in one front window, a
boarding and lodging house, and three or four saloons
and gambling houses, these last designed to catch the
wages of the miners from the surrounding camps.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell having found one of the superintendents
who had come down with a team for supplies, they were
soon on their way up the gulch, and in the course of
an hour were left at the office buildings, while the team
went on to the mines.</p>
<p>Here Rutherford waited in the outer room of the little
unpainted, frame building, while Mr. Blaisdell took
Houston into the further room, and introduced him to
Morgan, the general superintendent, and to his work,
at the same time. Then, having seen Houston duly installed
at his post of duty, perched on a wabbly stool,
before a rickety, ink-bespattered desk, beside a window
gray with the dust and smoke of ages, through which a
few straggling sunbeams fell, Mr. Blaisdell sailed complacently
forth to escort Rutherford to Jim Maverick&rsquo;s
boarding house, whither the baggage had already been
taken by the team; then, all necessary arrangements for
rooms and board having been completed, he went out
to the mines, leaving Rutherford alone in the camp of
the Philistines. He found no one, however, more formidable
than Mrs. Maverick, an old woman bent nearly
double, with white hair and hollow, deep-sunken eyes,
so faded it was impossible to tell what their original
color might have been, and the &ldquo;help,&rdquo; a stout, red-cheeked,
coarse-featured girl of fifteen, whom Mrs. Maverick
called &ldquo;Minty,&rdquo; but who rejoiced in the euphonious
name of Araminta Bixby, and who ogled and grinned at
Rutherford until he found the task of preserving his dignity
more difficult than ever.</p>
<p>In the course of an hour he sauntered down to the
office to meet Houston, and a little later the two sat in
the porch of the low, wide-spreading house, partly frame
and partly of logs, the roof of the porch supported by
the trunks of slender trees, unhewn, from which even
the bark had not been removed.</p>
<p>From the porch there was a view of the lake, and in
the distance the gleaming cascades, while just opposite,
the gulch road followed its winding course and disappeared
among the mountains.</p>
<p>Presently there came up the winding road three men,
apparently father and sons,&ndash;&ndash;low-browed, heavy-eyed,
brutal looking creatures,&ndash;&ndash;who followed the foot path
up toward the house, and glaring sullenly at the young
men, shuffled around to the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently mine host and his sons,&rdquo; remarked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Rutherford, &ldquo;I think if I see a few
more such specimens as those, I&rsquo;ll take the first train
out. Say though, I haven&rsquo;t seen a sign of that school
teacher, I begin to think she is a myth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; said Houston quickly, under his breath, &ldquo;see
what you think of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford turned in the direction Houston was facing,
and had two beings just then descended from the
mythical regions, he could not have been more astonished
than at sight of the pair approaching from the
lake. The first was a young girl, apparently about sixteen,
but tall and well developed, the scant garments
that she wore revealing the beautifully rounded outlines
of her form, her carriage free and every movement full
of grace. Her face was exquisitely beautiful, the features
refined and perfect as though chiseled in marble;
her eyes shone with a star-like brilliancy, and her hair
fell about her shoulders like a mass of burnished gold.</p>
<p>Beside her was a woman several years her senior,
equally beautiful, but an altogether different type of
beauty; more mature, more perfect and more rare. Tall
and splendidly developed, she moved with a queenly
grace. Her face was classical in its contours, the profile
resembling that of some of the old Grecians, while its
beauty was so refined, so subtile, it could not be easily
described. Perhaps the eyes were its chief attraction;
large and dark, and of Madonna-like depth and tenderness;
soulful eyes that reflected every emotion of the
pure, womanly nature, as the calm lake mirrors the sunlit
sky or the lowering storm-cloud, the silvery moon
or the lightning&rsquo;s flash. The wavy, auburn hair, tinged
in the sunlight with red gold, was gathered into a knot
near the top of a shapely, well-poised head, while stray
curls clustered rebelliously about the broad, fair brow,
forming a shining aureole.</p>
<p>Like a vision, the pair passed silently into the house,
leaving Rutherford, for once in his life, speechless, and
Houston watching him, apparently enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my boy?&rdquo; he asked, in a low,
laughing tone, &ldquo;Are you spell-bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spell-bound? well, slightly!&rdquo; responded Rutherford.
&ldquo;Great Heavens, Houston! do they have such women
as those out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently they have some fine samples of the genuine
article, but I am not prepared to state how large a
stock they carry. I&rsquo;m positive of one thing though, that
within the last three minutes you have changed your
mind about taking the next train out. Not all the desperadoes
and villains you&rsquo;ve met from Valley City out,
could drive you away from the mountains now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, they couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rutherford, with
a broad grin, &ldquo;not if I know myself; no, sir, when I&rsquo;m in
the line of duty nothing can scare me out of it worth a
cent, and just now I feel it to be my duty to solve
some of the mysteries thickening around me, among
them, that of the mountain nymphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether too substantial for mountain nymphs, my
boy,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;and you will please remember,
while pursuing your line of duty, that I have vouched
for your good behavior here, and am in a measure responsible
for you, and I don&rsquo;t want to get into any
trouble on your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford cleared his throat, and rising slowly with
all the dignity he could muster, looked gravely over his
glasses at Houston in exact imitation of Mr. Blaisdell,
and in an oracular tone remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will please remember, my young friend, that
I am out here as your duly constituted guardian, and as
such, it is my duty to form the acquaintance of these&ndash;&ndash;ahem!&ndash;&ndash;these
fair daughters of Eve, and judge for myself
whether or not they will be suitable companions for
an unsophisticated youth, like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Houston, and after a few more jokes,
dinner being announced by the moon-faced Minty, they
went in to partake of their first meal in what Rutherford
styled the &ldquo;Hotel de Maverick.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_VIII' id='CHAPTER_VIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>A few moments later, Houston and his friend had been
duly presented by Mrs. Maverick, to Miss Gladden
and to &ldquo;our daughter, Lyle,&rdquo; the former in a gown of
soft, clinging material, of a delicate, golden tint, combined
with a reddish brown velvet, which suited her
style of beauty to perfection; and Lyle, in dainty white
apron, her beautiful hair loosely plaited in an enormous
braid, prepared to act in the capacity of waiter.</p>
<p>Never were guests served so deftly, or with such grace
and dignity; she seemed absolutely free from all coquettish
airs, and although the glances of the two gentlemen
were about evenly divided between the beauty at
their side and the fair waitress, Lyle carried herself with
an equanimity that was remarkable. Not until the arrival,
later, of the other boarders, Morgan, the general
superintendent, and Haight, the mining expert,&ndash;&ndash;so-called,
though his expertness embraced much beside
mining,&ndash;&ndash;was there any change in her demeanor; then
her eyes flashed, her lips curled, and a look of superb
scorn passed over her face, an expression that reminded
Rutherford unaccountably of the face he had seen at
Valley City.</p>
<p>Old Jim Maverick and his sons were not present, having
taken their meal hastily in the kitchen. Beside her
husband and sons, poor, old Mrs. Maverick was positively
refined. She was a kind-hearted, motherly
woman, and looked as though, in her younger days, she
might have been very pretty, but poverty, hard work and
abuse had very nearly obliterated all traces of youthful
bloom, and her face had a hopeless, appealing look
which was pathetic.</p>
<p>A little later, Mr. Blaisdell arrived, rubbing his hands
and smiling in his usual complacent manner, and he entertained
the guests for some time with anecdotes of
western life, some of them very well told, but in most
of which it was noticeable that he bore a very prominent
part.</p>
<p>After dinner, Houston returned to the office in company
with Morgan and the expert, two new characters
which he was studying attentively. The former was a
tall, raw-boned individual, with a genial, good-natured
manner, but a weak face; one who would willingly be
a tool for any villain, but an unreliable tool. He would
betray his best friend, and knowing nothing of honor
himself, he did not believe in its existence, among men
or women. To him, all men were rogues, all business
simply gambling on a large scale, and his only care was
to be on the winning side.</p>
<p>Haight was a small, dark man, with soft, insinuating
manner, and, in accordance with his pet theory that
every person, high or low, rich or poor, might sometime
be useful to him in the furtherance of his own objects,
he treated every one with punctilious politeness. To
some his manner might have been pleasing, but to one
with any degree of penetration, the crafty, scheming nature
under the thin veneer was very apparent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rutherford had rather reluctantly accepted
an invitation from Mr. Blaisdell to go through
the mills and visit one or two of the less important
mines. The young easterner was soon much interested,
as, after having explored one of the smaller mines, the
Peep o&rsquo;Day,&ndash;&ndash;which he thought very appropriately
named as he glanced upward from a depth of a few hundred
feet,&ndash;&ndash;he was taken to the mills, and there saw the
various stages through which the ores pass in the process
of reduction. He almost forgot his dislike of Mr.
Blaisdell as he listened to his explanation of the different
classes of ore, and the various kinds of treatment which
they required, and met some of his old college acquaintances,&ndash;&ndash;the
sulphates, nitrates, carbonates, and other
members of that numerous family,&ndash;&ndash;in new and startling
array; for Mr. Blaisdell was thoroughly at home in
chemistry and mineralogy, and enjoyed nothing so
much as airing the knowledge he possessed in that one
direction. Of other branches of science, and even on
subjects of general information, he was profoundly ignorant,
although blissfully unconscious of the fact.</p>
<p>Rutherford was next shown the method by which the
ore ready for shipment was conveyed down the mountain
to the cars on the spur tracks, hundreds of feet below,
by means of a rail tramway on trestle work, some
three thousand feet in length, having a grade of nine
feet per each hundred feet, over which cars of ore were
passing, operated by gravity, the weight and velocity of
the descending, loaded car, carrying the empty car upward.
He thoroughly enjoyed these novel scenes, and
congratulated himself upon the many picturesque mining
views which he would add to his collection.</p>
<p>As they were passing through one of the sorting
rooms, they came upon Mr. Haight seated before a large
table covered with specimens of ore, which he was examining
with a powerful microscope, while beside him
were various chemical and mechanical appliances for
testing the different ores. Rutherford was enthusiastic
in his admiration of the specimens, particularly those
from the copper mines, with their beautiful coloring,&ndash;&ndash;the
blending tints of green and purple and blue,&ndash;&ndash;and he
created considerable amusement by his ecstasies over a
large sample of iron pyrites, which he had mistaken for a
splendid specimen of gold ore. Altogether it was a
novel and pleasant experience for him, and when he
joined Houston later, he felt himself considerably wiser
in western lore.</p>
<p>After supper, Mr. Blaisdell and Haight returned to the
office for a private conference regarding some new ores
which the latter had been testing. Morgan strolled
down the gulch in the direction of the Y, drawn by the
attractions of the gambling house and dance hall, leaving
the two strangers to seek their own amusement, or
to be entertained by Miss Gladden; they chose the latter,
and, since among the mountains as on the ocean,
friendships are quickly formed, the three were soon chatting
as pleasantly, out in the low, rustic porch, as though
their acquaintance dated back a number of days, instead
of only a few hours. At the kitchen door, old Jim
Maverick and his sons, with a dozen or so miners,
lounged about, smoking their pipes, and enlivened by
the blushing, giggling Miss Bixby.</p>
<p>With the latter crowd Lyle would never mingle, much
to the indignation of Maverick himself, and the chagrin
of two or three would-be admirers, and not feeling at
liberty to join, unasked, the group in the porch, she
withdrew to her little room up-stairs, and taking from its
hiding place one of the new books her friend had
brought her, she was for a while unconscious of everything
else. Then, as the twilight deepened, she closed
the book, and having again concealed it, sat watching
the stars just beginning to appear, one by one, and musing,
as she often did, on her own life. Why had she not,
with her passionate love of the beautiful and her thirst
for knowledge, been given the birth and training, the
social advantages of any one of that little group below?
Or, if the fates had decreed that she must be born in
such ignorance and degradation, and spend her life in
such surroundings, why had they not given her a nature
corresponding to her environment, as indifferent and
unaspiring as that of the phlegmatic Miss Bixby? Why
must she always feel as if she had been born to a better
life than this, when in all probability, it must always go
on in the same old routine which she hated and despised?
She wondered what Jack meant by the questions
he had asked her so often lately, as to where they
had lived before coming to the mountains, and regarding
her earliest recollections. Well, what were her earliest
recollections? Something so shadowy she could not
determine whether it were remembrance or imagination;
but it was a vague idea of light and music and beauty;
and why was it that when she heard or read of that
bright life, so foreign to her, of which she had never had
one glimpse, that it all seemed somehow half familiar?
She did not believe she would be very awkward or out
of place, if she could step for the first time into some
of those bright scenes as she imagined them; why did it
all seem so home-like to her?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the little group below were discussing the
same problem that Lyle herself was trying to solve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; Rutherford was saying, &ldquo;how
such a style of beauty, so delicate and refined you know,
could ever exist in such surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a mystery,&rdquo; added Houston, &ldquo;and unless I am
greatly mistaken, she has a nature as sensitive and refined
as her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Mr. Houston,&rdquo; replied Miss Gladden,
&ldquo;she possesses a refinement of nature that is wonderful;
and not only that, she has a brilliant intellect if she could
only have advantages, and notwithstanding all the difficulties
and obstacles with which she has had to contend,
she has already acquired a fair education, is remarkably
well informed and a good conversationalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, Lyle was aroused from her
revery by a familiar voice calling her, and coming down
stairs, found Miss Gladden awaiting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You runaway!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;why have you been
hiding when you should have been helping me entertain
the new guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you needed any help,&rdquo; replied Lyle,
brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never made a worse mistake in your life,&rdquo; said
Miss Gladden, leading the way out on the porch. &ldquo;I
have been trying to tell these gentlemen something
about this country around here, and I have only succeeded
in betraying my own ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both gentlemen greeted Lyle pleasantly, and Houston
rose and gave her his chair with a grave, gentle
courtesy which was new to her, and which she was
quick to observe and appreciate. For some time they
chatted of the surrounding country, Lyle telling them
where the finest scenery, the best hunting and fishing
and the pleasantest picnic grounds were to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a quarter of a mile from here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in
Strawberry gulch is a small canyon that has been fitted
up for tourists and excursionists, and every summer
numerous camping parties come out from Silver City
for a few days or weeks. There is a fine lake at the
head of the canyon, a boat house, and a good supply of
boats, tents, and almost everything needed for camp
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have there been any camping parties yet?&rdquo; asked
Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Lyle. &ldquo;It is too early; they usually
begin coming in July; we are likely to have snow-storms
out here in the mountains yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow-storms!&rdquo; they all exclaimed; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said
Miss Gladden, &ldquo;after such warm weather as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Lyle, &ldquo;this is only the early warm
weather we always have in May, but it will be much
colder again before summer really begins in earnest;
though the weather is never so severe here as in the
gulches farther up the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of the
greatest number of &lsquo;gulches&rsquo; out here, and some of them
have the most remarkable names; very original, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their names are mostly indicative of their early history,&rdquo;
Lyle answered; &ldquo;there are a number of them in
this vicinity,&ndash;&ndash;Last Chance gulch, Poor Man&rsquo;s gulch,
Lucky gulch, Bloody gulch, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has this gulch where we are, any such euphonious
title?&rdquo; inquired Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one has two names, equally euphonious and
equally historical; it is now called Spotted Horse gulch,
but years since it was known as Dead Man&rsquo;s gulch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds cheerful!&rdquo; commented Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a ghost story connected with the gulch, Miss
Maverick?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lyle, &ldquo;several of them, for the miners are
mostly very superstitious. Years ago, when there were
no well developed mines here, only a few prospects, a
man who had just sold one of the properties, was murdered
for his money, about half way between here and
the mines, where the road is so narrow and passes under
the overhanging rocks. He rode a spotted horse, and
from the indications when he was found a few days after,
he must have made a desperate fight, for both he and
the horse were shot several times. Ever since, it has
been said that the spotted horse goes up and down the
gulch at night, sometimes alone, and sometimes with
his rider, and so the gulch received its name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that story still believed here?&rdquo; asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; replied Lyle. &ldquo;There is just enough
faith in it, that, excepting Jack,&rdquo; and she nodded slightly
to Miss Gladden, &ldquo;there is not a miner in camp who
could be hired to pass through that part of the gulch at
midnight, for fear of seeing the phantom horse and his
rider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;it would be well for
us to adjourn for the night, or we may have a glimpse of
the phantoms; it must be after ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ten, impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Rutherford,
springing to his feet; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, ladies, for
having detained you so long; I never dreamed it was
so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long twilight here deceives one, I have hardly
become accustomed to it myself,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ladies will surely pardon us,&rdquo; said Houston,
&ldquo;since it is through their making the time pass so pleasantly
that we have trespassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated for the night, and a little later, Mr.
Blaisdell and Haight came up from the office, but Morgan
did not return until daylight was beginning to tinge
the eastern sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>
<p>A number of days passed uneventfully. Houston was
occupied in getting familiarized with the work at the
office, having first created an epoch in the history of
that institution by having the windows thoroughly
cleaned.</p>
<p>One of the noted characters of the mining camp was
a small boy who, when he could scarcely walk, had, on
account of his fearless spirit and indomitable pluck, been
dubbed with the name of &ldquo;Bull-dog.&rdquo; The name was
so appropriate, and the little fellow himself so proud
of it, that as he grew older it was forgotten if he ever
had any other; if he had, no one knew what it was. He
was now nearly twelve years of age, as small as
most boys of eight or nine, but he possessed the same
spirit as of old. Bull-dog was the oldest of five children;
his parents lived at the Y, a worthless, disreputable
pair; he spent very little time under the parental
roof, and filial respect was entirely left out of his composition,
and no wonder! He was a favorite among the
miners, spending much of his time in the camp, and the
shrewd little fellow was very observant of what went on
around him, and very keen and worldly-wise in his judgment
of human nature as he found it.</p>
<p>He speedily made the acquaintance of Houston, and
when the latter came down to the office on his second
morning, he found the boy awaiting him, and an idea
occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bull-dog, can you wash windows?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet yer life,&rdquo; was the laconic reply, accompanied by
a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you charge me for washing these four?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small individual surveyed the windows critically,
then answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see how good a job
you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours afterward the windows were shining, and
Houston paid the little fellow an equally shining dollar,
instead of the six bits, thus making of Bull-dog a friend
for life, and one whose friendship afterward proved of
great value.</p>
<p>Nearly every afternoon found Lyle at Jack&rsquo;s cabin, diligently
reading or studying, guarded by Rex, the faithful
collie, who would let no one but Lyle enter the cabin
while Jack and Mike were at their work. Two or three
evenings of each week she spent there, reviewing her lessons
with Jack, or listening, either to the stories which
he and Mike told of other countries, or to the music of
Mike&rsquo;s violin, fierce and wild, or sweet and pathetic, according
to the mood of the musician. The cabin, built
of logs and plaster, and consisting of two rooms and a
small attic, resembled miners&rsquo; cabins in general, with the
exception of the second and inner room. Here, the
floor was nearly covered with skins of animals, while on
the walls were shelves and brackets, hand-carved in delicate
designs, and filled with books and choice pictures,
beautiful etchings and photographs of various works of
art. A few larger pictures hung on the walls, framed in
some of the same skillfully carved work. The pine table,
covered with a brightly colored spread, was strewn
with finely bound volumes, and scattered about the room
were several comfortable folding chairs, which Jack
had bought in some of his trips to Silver City. A rude
fireplace had been built in one side of the room, over
which were arranged artistically two or three rifles, and
the heads and horns of various animals, while on the
mantel was a fine collection of ores. Altogether, it was
a pleasant room, and gave more evidence of good taste,
education and refinement than could have been found
for more than a score of miles in that region. This was
Jack&rsquo;s sanctum, and none but his two friends, Lyle and
Mike, were ever allowed within it.</p>
<p>In this room, a few evenings after the arrival of the
two strangers, Lyle was sitting with her friends. The
weather was already much cooler, and a bright fire was
burning, before which Rex was comfortably stretched,
while he watched the faces of his two friends, Jack and
Lyle, who, having finished their usual reading, were
silent for a few moments, looking into the fire and listening
to Mike as he sat in his corner, his eyes closed, his
head bent lovingly over his violin, while he evoked some
of the wild, plaintive airs of his native country.</p>
<p>Jack was the first to speak, as he asked in a low tone,
&ldquo;You have met the young men I spoke of the other evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lyle, still gazing into the fire, &ldquo;they
are stopping at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will they remain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger one, the one you particularly admired, is
to stop for a few weeks only; the other will probably remain
permanently, as he is bookkeeper for the mining
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack gave an almost imperceptible start, but slight as
it was, Lyle noticed it, and turning quickly, saw a peculiar
expression of mingled surprise, perplexity and annoyance
on his usually immobile face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bookkeeper for the mining company!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;are you sure you are correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only quote for my authority the Honorable J.
O. Blaisdell,&rdquo; she replied archly, &ldquo;you surely wouldn&rsquo;t
doubt his word under any circumstances, would you?
You look surprised; did you consider Mr. Houston one
of the &lsquo;lilies&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked at her inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the &lsquo;lilies&rsquo; like Mr. Rutherford,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;who &lsquo;toil not neither do they spin,&rsquo; I supposed
him one at first, but I think differently now; I believe
he would always be a worker of some kind, whether it
were necessary or not; at the same time I don&rsquo;t believe
it is exactly necessary for him to be a bookkeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have made a study of him,&rdquo; remarked
Jack, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Lyle, &ldquo;what else are my eyes
and my small stock of brains for, but to study everybody
and everything that comes in my way? Besides, it&rsquo;s
rather interesting to find a person of some depth, after
such shallow people as Mr. Blaisdell and Haight, and
that class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, Lyle,&rdquo; said Jack, slowly, &ldquo;these deep people
make a dangerous study; they are likely to become
too interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you fear for me, Jack,&rdquo; said the girl, with considerable
spirit, but kindly, &ldquo;I know too well how the
world would look upon old Jim Maverick&rsquo;s daughter,
to carry my heart on my sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were silent for a moment, Jack watching her
face intently. Mike had left the room. Lyle continued,
in a gentler tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston is a perfect gentleman; he would make
a safe study for me, even if I didn&rsquo;t realize my position.
He reminds me of you, Jack, in some ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me!&rdquo; said Jack sarcastically, &ldquo;your Mr. Houston
would doubtless feel nattered at being compared to
a weather-beaten miner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not always a miner,&rdquo; retorted Lyle quickly,
&ldquo;and you are a gentleman, and always will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your opinion, child,&rdquo; said Jack pleasantly; then
turning the subject, he asked, &ldquo;What do you think of
the &lsquo;lily&rsquo; as you styled him, Mr. Rutherford, I think you
called his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is a gentlemanly fellow, not so ridiculous as
he looks; good-hearted, but not deep like the other,&ndash;&ndash;not
half so interesting to study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;go on with your &lsquo;study,&rsquo;
but I wish you would make a little more of a study of
yourself and of your own life,&rdquo; and as he spoke, he carelessly
took up a magazine and began turning the pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; answered Lyle slowly, at the
same time going over to the table where she had caught
sight of a photograph which had evidently been concealed
by the magazine, &ldquo;my life before you became my
friend and teacher would not make an interesting study
for any one.&ndash;&ndash;Oh, Jack, whose picture is this? and when
did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Jack, answering indifferently, but watching
her face keenly, &ldquo;Oh, that is a picture I&rsquo;ve had a
great while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jack, I never saw it, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lyle, I haven&rsquo;t seen it myself for years, until to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for years? how strange!&rdquo; said Lyle in a low tone;
then looking wistfully at the picture, she said, half to
herself, &ldquo;She must have been some one you loved some
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very dear to me,&rdquo; he replied, so quietly that
Lyle said nothing, but remained looking long and earnestly
at the photograph. It was the picture of a young
girl, a few years older than herself, but much more matured,
and wondrously beautiful. The features were almost
perfect, and the eyes, even there, seemed so radiant
and tender. There seemed a wealth of love and sympathy
in those eyes that touched Lyle&rsquo;s lonely heart, and
her own eyes filled with tears, while she gazed as if under
a spell; then she asked in a sort of bewildered tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I never saw her, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not while you have been here,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I cannot say whom you may have seen before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I came here,&rdquo; repeated Lyle dreamily, laying
down the picture and preparing to go, &ldquo;that is a sort of
blank for the most part. It seems as though this hateful
life had obliterated everything before it; the early
years of my life seem buried out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to resurrect them,&rdquo; said Jack, adding, &ldquo;Keep
your eyes and ears open, and let me know results. Had
I not better go home with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, thank you,&rdquo; said Lyle, smiling brightly, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Rex must go,&rdquo; and Rex who was only waiting
for the word bounded to the door to signify his readiness.</p>
<p>After Lyle had gone, Jack took the picture, and after
looking at it sadly for a moment, replaced it in the little
case in his trunk where it had lain so long, and then sat
down by the fire, muttering, &ldquo;Strange she did not see
the resemblance! I hoped she would; there could not
be two faces more alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the way home, Lyle was thinking of the beautiful
face, wondering where she had seen it, that it should
seem so familiar, and after dismissing Rex with a caress,
she sat for some time in the low porch, trying to solve
the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; she said to herself at length, &ldquo;it is no
face I have ever seen, unless in some of those strange
dreams I used to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going into the house, she found her parents had retired.
Rutherford sat in his room reading, waiting for
Houston, who was working late that night, Mr. Blaisdell
having gone back to the city for a day or two. Miss
Gladden was writing in her room, but Lyle would not
disturb her, and going quietly to her own little room,
she was soon sleeping peacefully, and the beautiful face
was for a time forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning was several degrees colder, and
there were indications of a snow-storm. Within doors,
the atmosphere betokened a coming storm, as old Jim
Maverick was several degrees more quarrelsome and
ugly-tempered than usual. He glared sullenly at Lyle,
as she stepped quietly about the kitchen, preparing the
early breakfast that he and the boys took before starting
for their work.</p>
<p>Finally he growled, &ldquo;What was you doin&rsquo; out so late
last night? Pretty time &rsquo;twas when you come in,
where&rsquo;d you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle seemed to take no notice of his questions for a
moment, then replied, without a glance at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not out late; I went out for a walk early in
the evening, and came back early, but I staid out on the
porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied with a sneer, &ldquo;so you was settin&rsquo; out
there waitin&rsquo; for the new clerk to come home, wasn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know he was out of the house,&rdquo; said
Lyle, indifferent to his sneers, so long as he did not mistrust
where she had really spent the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not! I understand you pretty well,
and don&rsquo;t you forgit it, always puttin&rsquo; on your damned
airs round here, too nice for any of your own folks; I&rsquo;d
like to see you made a fool of by some of the dudes
you&rsquo;re so stuck on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never will have that pleasure,&rdquo; replied Lyle,
coolly, &ldquo;I know too well the opinion that people have of
you and your family, to ever be in any danger of being
made a fool of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Jim&rsquo;s face grew livid with rage, and he clenched
his hand with an oath, but hearing some of the boarders
coming in to breakfast in the next room, he only
hissed, with a terrible leer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, even if you are my child, with that doll-face
o&rsquo; yourn, you might rope in that rich young feller
for a few thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle staggered under the insult as if she had received
a blow, and pale and trembling, went into the next room
to wait on the guests. She was relieved to see that Rutherford
was not there; she felt she could not have faced
him while those words of her father&rsquo;s were ringing in
her ears. There was only Mr. Houston, who greeted her
with his usual gentle courtesy, and Morgan, whom she
despised.</p>
<p>Out in the kitchen, however, her cause was being
championed by Mrs. Maverick, the fire flashing from her
faded eyes, as she talked in a manner very unusual for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may abuse me as much as you like, Jim Maverick,&rdquo;
she was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nothing but abuse from
you for the past twenty years, and I don&rsquo;t never expect
nothing else, but if you ever lay a hand on that girl, or
speak to her like that again, you&rsquo;ll be sorry for it. I can
make you smart for it, and you know it, and I&rsquo;ll do it
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys, Joe and Jim, aged respectively twenty and
eighteen, stared at their mother in astonishment, but
their father, several shades paler, ordered them from the
house; then advancing toward his wife, shaking his fist
and cursing her, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned old fool! do you think you can try to
scare me? you&rsquo;ll find &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t very healthy business for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill me, if you want to,&rdquo; she replied doggedly, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll find it won&rsquo;t make you any better off; I&rsquo;ve fixed
you for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, now thoroughly
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean!&rdquo; said his wife, as she saw that she at last had
the brute in her power, &ldquo;it means that you&rsquo;ve got to let
that girl alone, and behave yourself to me, or you&rsquo;ll
wish you had, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, Minty entered on the scene, her round eyes
wide open with astonishment, and Lyle entering an instant
later from the breakfast room, Maverick slunk
away to his work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other boarders were gathering in the
breakfast room, Miss Gladden and Rutherford being the
last to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter, rubbing his hands,
&ldquo;this seems a little wintry, doesn&rsquo;t it? Looks like a storm,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morgan, glancing up, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll probably have
a snow-storm before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you pleasure seekers intend to spend the
day?&rdquo; inquired Houston, addressing Miss Gladden and
Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall spend it beside the fire,&rdquo; replied Miss
Gladden, shivering slightly, and sitting down for a moment
beside the little box stove, where a wood fire was
crackling and spluttering; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite decided what
to do, because I didn&rsquo;t come out here prepared for snow-storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a day off and
develop some of the pictures I&rsquo;ve taken lately, and sort
over my collection of views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be delightful,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden,
smiling brightly at Lyle who had entered the room in
time to hear Rutherford&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;We will make Mr.
Rutherford entertain us with his collection, won&rsquo;t we
Lyle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle smiled in assent, but Miss Gladden very quickly
detected traces of trouble in her face, and determined,
if possible, to gain her confidence, and find the cause.
Rutherford also noticed the change in her appearance,
and remarked, after she had again left the room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Maverick doesn&rsquo;t look like herself this morning,
I wonder what is the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there has been a storm of some kind in the
kitchen,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;I heard pretty loud talk
when I first came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morgan, joining in the conversation, &ldquo;she
and the old man have some high old times, once in a
while; and one thing is curious, the girl never seems
afraid of him, and that&rsquo;s more than can be said of many
of the men around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Houston, &ldquo;is he considered dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a pretty tough customer,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;I
guess there&rsquo;s no job too dirty for him to do, if he&rsquo;s only
paid for it;&rdquo; and then added carelessly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the kind
of a man Blaisdell likes to have &rsquo;round once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he do?&rdquo; asked Houston, &ldquo;does he work
in the mines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to,&rdquo; replied Morgan, &ldquo;but he don&rsquo;t do any
more underground work, he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; interrupted Haight, with a peculiar emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, in some ways, plenty of it,&rdquo; laughed Morgan,
&ldquo;but I was speaking of the mines; he&rsquo;s a sort of
foreman now in one of &rsquo;em, and tends to the sorting of
the ore occasionally; helps Haight out sometimes, when
he has a particularly delicate job on hand,&rdquo; and Morgan
winked across the table at the expert, who smiled knowingly
in return.</p>
<p>Lyle coming into the room again, the talk regarding
Maverick ceased, but when she had left, Morgan continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a queer girl; she gives it to the old man sometimes,
up and down; the boys don&rsquo;t dare give him any
lip, but she&rsquo;s no more afraid of him, than&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than she is of you,&rdquo; again interrupted Haight, with
a smile that seemed to discompose Morgan considerably,
for he colored and bit his lip.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden looked annoyed, as did Houston, and
Rutherford, feeling something was amiss, unintentionally
said about the worst thing he could just at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Miss Maverick is an awfully nice girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all think so,&rdquo; said Haight, in his blandest manner,
&ldquo;Mr. Morgan especially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Morgan, angrily, but trying to speak indifferently,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s nice enough, as nice as girls of her
class generally are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a look of scorn and contempt that neither Haight
nor Morgan soon forgot, Miss Gladden rose from the
table and left the room, while Rutherford exclaimed indignantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever &lsquo;her class&rsquo; is, she is deucedly your superior,
you contemptible puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle just then entering, there was an ominous silence
for an instant; then Houston, rising from the table, remarked
in a cool, even tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been enough said for the present, but&rdquo;
turning toward Morgan and Haight, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something
to say to you two, a little later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan put on his hat and started sullenly for the office,
but Haight, assuming his most ingratiating smile,
stepped up to Houston, and, in a low tone, began to
apologize. Houston interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need of any words here,&rdquo; he said coldly,
&ldquo;I shall call on you at the sorting rooms this morning,
and shall then have something to say to you, but I wish
no words from you, at all,&rdquo; and retiring to his room, he
left Haight in a state of considerable trepidation. He
hurried after Morgan, and soon overtook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got that new fellow stirred
up, and I wish we hadn&rsquo;t; I don&rsquo;t want any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang you, you little, sneaking coward!&rdquo; answered
Morgan, &ldquo;if you didn&rsquo;t want trouble, why didn&rsquo;t you hold
your tongue? Whatever fuss there is you&rsquo;ve kicked up
yourself, with your own smartness, so what are you whining
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know my principles, Morgan; I never
want quarrels with anybody; you know the old saying,
&lsquo;the good will of a dog is better than&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;you make me tired!
You&rsquo;re a damned coward, and that&rsquo;s all there is about it.
It&rsquo;s my opinion, though, in the case of this dog, that his
bark is a good deal worse than his bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Houston was preparing to go to the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, old boy,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t I better go
down with you? You may have some trouble, you know,
and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they would be two pretty nasty
fellows to meddle with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged, Ned,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;but I can take
care of those two fellows, and twenty more just like them.
Haight is an out and out coward, he wouldn&rsquo;t fight any
more than he would cut his own throat. Morgan would
show fight, perhaps, but I&rsquo;d finish him up before he even
knew where he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I put my foot in it, saying what I did,&rdquo; said
Rutherford, staring through his eye-glasses in a meditative
manner, &ldquo;but it did make me hot, their insinuating
things in that way about such a nice little girl as Lyle,
and before Miss Gladden, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no more of it, that is certain,&rdquo; replied
Houston decidedly, and he was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>
<p>A few moments later, Houston stepped briskly into
the office. Morgan sat at his desk, sorting some mining
reports, and looked up with a sullen, defiant glance, but
Houston ignored him, and going to his own desk, began
making preparations for his day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Bull-dog, who, since washing the windows, had constituted
himself office boy, had built the fire and was now
sweeping. Houston greeted him pleasantly, but his keen
eyes at once detected trouble between Houston and Morgan,
and he was immediately on the alert.</p>
<p>After the little fellow had finished his work, and Houston
supposed he had gone, he walked with a firm, decided
step, over to where Morgan stood lounging and
looking out of the window. Morgan turned, and angry
as he was, he could not help a feeling of admiration for
the splendid, athletic form standing, firm as a rock, before
him. Houston&rsquo;s keen, dark eyes looked straight
into his own, and for a moment, not a muscle of his face
moved, the finely cut features might have been chiseled
in stone; then he spoke, in even, measured tones, cold
and cutting as steel itself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morgan, I have this much to say to you, and it
will be well for you to remember it; that if I ever hear
another insinuation against that young lady of whom
you were speaking this morning, or an improper word
of any kind in the presence of either of those ladies at
the house, I will put you in such shape, that you will not
be able to come to the office for a week; and more than
that, there will be no office work here for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that last threat?&rdquo; asked Morgan
defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just this; that I know enough about you,
that if I should repeat what I know to Mr. Blaisdell, you
would not remain in this office one day longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan grew pale. &ldquo;You seem to know a great deal
for a man that&rsquo;s been here no longer than you have. I
suppose Lyle Maverick has been filling you up with stuff
about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has never mentioned your name to me, and you
will do well not to bring her name into this conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;re wonderfully particular about old
Jim Maverick&rsquo;s girl,&rdquo; Morgan sneered, &ldquo;I suppose you
want her for yourself, though I should think the other
one&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan never finished his sentence; a blow that he
afterwards said was &ldquo;worse than the kick of a mule,&rdquo; had
closed one eye.</p>
<p>With an oath, he made a terrible lunge toward Houston,
but he knew nothing more until about fifteen minutes
later, when he found himself lying on the floor, under
the long desk, on the opposite side of the room, while
Houston stood a few feet away, watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dirty contemptible cur!&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;do you
think because you have no sense of honor, because you
are so vile you can have no idea of what purity means,
that every one is like yourself? You deserve to be
kicked like a dog; come out from there and fight, why
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m very anxious to, if you&rsquo;d just as
soon excuse me,&rdquo; said Morgan, who had gradually assumed
a sitting posture, and was passing his hand over
his eye and jaw. Then, looking up with as much of a
grin as he could muster, with his rapidly swelling face,
he said, &ldquo;Give it up, Houston; you&rsquo;re a better man than
I am; I&rsquo;ll let you boss this ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; asked Houston sternly, &ldquo;that from
this time there will be no more insinuations against
ladies, and no innuendoes in their presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I agree,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say anything
myself, and I&rsquo;ll smash any other fellow that does; I
think,&rdquo; he added, reflectively, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve showed me
how pretty well, though I&rsquo;d a little rather you&rsquo;d practiced
on some other fellow, Haight, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to Haight,&rdquo; said Houston, helping Morgan
to his feet, and smiling grimly at the figure he made.</p>
<p>An hour later, Houston presented himself at the sorting
rooms, where Haight met him with many smiles,
offering to show him through the rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time will do, Mr. Haight,&rdquo; said Houston
coldly, &ldquo;I have business with yourself this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Haight, as if the thought had just occurred
to him, &ldquo;that unfortunate business at the table
this morning; Mr. Houston, I am more than sorry for
what happened, and assure you, that, so far as I am concerned,
it shall never occur again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be much better for your interests that it should
not,&rdquo; replied Houston; &ldquo;I have not been in the habit of
hearing such insinuations against ladies, or such language
in their presence; and there is something more
I have to say to you,&rdquo; he continued, as he saw Haight
was trying to speak; &ldquo;you were bookkeeper for the company,
for a while, were you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Haight in a tone of surprise, &ldquo;I
kept the books for a few months last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have been informed since coming here, and I
wish to state that the other day I had occasion to refer
to some of the old books kept by you, and I very soon
found evidences of a few shady transactions on your
part that I think you would not care to have come to the
knowledge of the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken, Mr. Houston,&rdquo; said Haight,
trying to preserve a calm exterior, but paling visibly;
&ldquo;it must have been some of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s work you
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Haight,&rdquo; said Houston firmly, &ldquo;it was your
own work, in your own writing, and very bunglingly
done at that; a man would not need to be an expert accountant,&ndash;&ndash;and
that is what I am,&ndash;&ndash;to detect the fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston,&rdquo; interrupted Haight, in trembling
tones, &ldquo;everything here shall be as you wish, and I will
help you too,&ndash;&ndash;I can be of use to you,&ndash;&ndash;if you will just
say nothing. There were certain circumstances that I
cannot now explain, that justified the transactions you
allude to; and as I have told you, I regret what occurred
this morning, and it shall not be repeated. But really,
Mr. Houston,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I had no idea that my
teasing Morgan this morning would have such an effect;
you see, what I was joking about was really to Miss Maverick&rsquo;s
credit; it seems that a few weeks ago, he was
rather smitten with her and attempted to be what she
thought was a little too familiar, and she gave him a
black eye, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has another one now,&rdquo; said Houston, rising abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Haight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there will be more black eyes if there are
any more insinuations of that character,&rdquo; and Houston
returned to the office, leaving behind him a bitter enemy,
but one whose enmity would be concealed by a cloak of
friendship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while Houston was pursuing his chivalric
course, Miss Gladden, sitting by the fire in the deserted
breakfast room, was planning in what way and by what
means she could best help her young friend in whom she
felt such an interest. The scene at the table had given
her a new insight into Lyle&rsquo;s surroundings; the rudeness
and insult to which the beautiful girl was likely to be subjected
in such a home, the possible dangers to which she
might also be exposed, and she was more than ever determined
to win the confidence of the reserved, proud-spirited
girl.</p>
<p>In the midst of her reflections, Lyle entered the room,
and Miss Gladden saw there were still traces of trouble
in her face. Unconscious of the friends who were beginning
to care for her welfare, Lyle had felt that morning
as though she could endure her life there no longer.
She had felt by a sort of instinct that she was in some
way connected with the talk at the table, and she knew
that both Morgan and Haight would not hesitate to injure
her by their insinuations, in retaliation for the manner
in which she had met their advances. Thirsting for
human sympathy, her heart quickly responded to Miss
Gladden&rsquo;s words, as she told Lyle of her interest in her,
her sympathy for her, and her desire to help her, and in
reply to one or two questions, she spoke freely of the
trials she had suffered, inevitably connected with a life
such as hers, and touched by the kindness of her new-found
friend, Lyle continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The insults and insinuations of those men, and others
like them, are bad enough, but I expect nothing else from
such as they, but when one receives insult from the
source where one would expect protection,&ndash;&ndash;that is hardest
of all,&rdquo; and with flushed cheeks and quivering lips,
Lyle related the scene with her father, and his words to
her, while Miss Gladden looked inexpressibly shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was almost desperate this morning,&rdquo; she said in
conclusion, &ldquo;I felt as though I could not live such a life
any longer; I must go somewhere, anywhere, to get
away from it. Mother says that nothing of that kind shall
ever happen again, that father is in her power in some
way, and she will not let him abuse me; but it is this
whole wretched life that I despise, if I could only be
freed from that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, dear, your life will not always be like this,&rdquo;
said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;it shall not be if it is in my power to
prevent it; perhaps I may be able to brighten it in some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have already,&rdquo; said Lyle gratefully, &ldquo;I shall be
happy now, as long as you are here; after you are gone
away,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she shuddered slightly, then added, &ldquo;who
knows what may happen before that time?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_XII' id='CHAPTER_XII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>
<p>A few hours later, a wild, mountain storm was raging
outside, the wind roaring down the canyon from the icy
fields above, driving the fast falling snow in every direction,
with blinding fury.</p>
<p>Within doors, however, a happy group were seated
around the fire, oblivious of the storm outside, or with
just enough consciousness of its fury to add to the enjoyment
of the warmth and comfort inside.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was, as usual, becomingly gowned in
a house dress of rich, warm color, while she had persuaded
Lyle to put on a dark blue dress of her own,
which, with a very little change, fitted as though originally
intended for her, and also to dress her beautiful, golden
hair high on her head, thus producing a change in
her appearance which astonished even Miss Gladden herself.</p>
<p>The perfectly fitting gown revealed the outlines of her
well developed and finely proportioned form; its color
seemed to enhance the delicacy of her face and the brilliancy
of her eyes, while the graceful coiffure showed to
good advantage the beautifully shaped head, and added
to her dignity. She seemed suddenly to have been transformed
from shy, reserved girlhood, to graceful, royal
womanhood.</p>
<p>As she, with Miss Gladden, entered the room where
Rutherford awaited them, that young gentleman started
suddenly, and turning, gazed at the regal little beauty,
with her golden coronet, in undisguised admiration,
much to the amusement of both ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what metamorphosis
is this? Excuse me, Miss Maverick, I really couldn&rsquo;t
help it; I thought you were a sort of little girl, you know,
and you are,&ndash;&ndash;begging your pardon,&ndash;&ndash;a very beautiful
young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both ladies laughed merrily, and Miss Gladden secretly
resolved that Lyle, in the future, should always be
dressed becomingly, if her influence could accomplish
anything in that direction.</p>
<p>The afternoon passed very pleasantly in looking over
the beautiful views which Rutherford had collected since
he left his distant, eastern home. The pictures taken
among the mountains had developed finely, and they all
grew enthusiastic over them. Then there were pictures
of his friends, in groups and singly, and in laughable
combinations and positions; among them, some which
Rutherford had taken of his friend, Tom Durston, and
his family, at the ranch where he had stopped over night
on his way out. There was one of Tom himself, in a futile
attempt to milk a refractory cow, where he lay sprawling
ingloriously upon the ground, the milk bucket pouring
its foaming contents over him, the excited cow performing
a war dance, while two others, more peaceably
inclined, looked on in mild-eyed astonishment: chickens
were flying in every direction, with outstretched necks
and wings, while in the background, a company of geese
were hissing their disapproval of the scene.</p>
<p>The girls laughed until the tears were in their eyes.
&ldquo;How did you ever get such a picture? and so perfect!&rdquo;
they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just happened to,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I was out that
morning, with my kodak all ready, looking for a subject,
and I saw Tom milking, and thought it would be fun to
take a picture of him to send back to the class-boys, you
know; I held the kodak up and was just ready&ndash;&ndash;when
that old cow sent him flying quicker than lightning, and
I caught the picture all right. I&rsquo;m going to mail him
one copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a picture of Tom&rsquo;s baby, taking his bath,
his mouth wide open and his eyes shut, crying lustily for
his mother, who had deserted him to run to Tom&rsquo;s assistance.
Then there were pictures of Rutherford&rsquo;s home
and friends, among them, that of a brother, older than
himself, which particularly attracted Lyle&rsquo;s attention;
she looked at it long and earnestly. He was sitting in
an easy attitude, smoking a cigar, and looking at the
face of a beautiful, dark-eyed girl, of about her own age,
which appeared above him, encircled by the light clouds
of smoke,&ndash;&ndash;just the face and no more. Rutherford
stated that it was his brother and their only sister, and
explained the process by which it was taken, but the
picture remained in Lyle&rsquo;s memory for many a day.</p>
<p>After a while, Houston, returning a little early on account
of the storm, joined them, and the four friends
spent the most enjoyable evening which they had yet
known together, notwithstanding the storm.</p>
<p>It had been an eventful day. To Lyle, and one or two
of the others, it was the beginning of a new life, though
they did not then realize it; the first, faint flush that heralds
the coming of the sun to brighten the new day, but
which is so subtle and silent, that few are aware of its
presence.</p>
<p>Houston, on his return to the house at noon, had
given, in answer to Rutherford&rsquo;s eager inquiries, an account
of the &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo; as he called it. Rutherford was
so proud of his friend, and of the victory he had won,
that at the first opportunity, he told the story to Miss
Gladden, before Houston had even returned to the office.
Miss Gladden was enthusiastic in her admiration
of the course he had taken, so different from many of the
young men she had known in wealthy, aristocratic circles,
in thus defending a poor, friendless girl, subject to
insult because she had the misfortune, under such circumstances,
to be beautiful; and obeying the impulses
of her noble-hearted, high-spirited nature, she went to
Houston, as she saw him standing alone a few minutes
after dinner, and extending her hand, with a bright
smile, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Knight, I want to thank you, in Lyle&rsquo;s name and
my own, for the chivalric course you have taken this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could get no further; Houston, still holding her
hand, interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not thank me, Miss Gladden; I have only done
what it is the duty of every true man to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, interrupting him in turn,
&ldquo;true men must be exceedingly rare. I know very few,
Mr. Houston, who would champion the cause of a girl
in Lyle&rsquo;s circumstances, in the manner you have done,&rdquo;
and then, with much feeling, she spoke of some of Lyle&rsquo;s
trials, and of her own determination to help her.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman is never so lovely as when defending
the cause of some sister less fortunate than herself,
and Houston thought he had never seen Miss Gladden
so beautiful as at that moment, and the thought must in
some way have conveyed itself to his eyes, for there was
something in his glance that brought a bright color to
Miss Gladden&rsquo;s cheek, and an added tenderness to her
soulful eyes; something that remained with her all that
day, and somehow made life, even in the heart of the
mountains, shut out from the rest of the world, look more
inviting, more alluring than it had ever done before.</p>
<p>With Houston, also, the memory of those eyes with
their depths of tenderness, and the hand whose touch
had thrilled him with its magnetism, lingered, and brightened
all that stormy afternoon.</p>
<p>To Lyle, this day seemed the beginning of a new
epoch in her solitary, isolated life. For the first time, she
had found genial companionship, human sympathy and
love, and chivalrous protection; for Miss Gladden had
hastened to tell her of the part Mr. Houston had taken
in her defense; and as the slowly maturing bud suddenly
unfolds in the morning sunlight, so in the new light
and warmth which she had found that day, her nature
had suddenly expanded into mature, conscious womanhood.</p>
<p>That evening, as the little group of friends were separating
for the night, Miss Gladden having already gone
up-stairs, Lyle, with a new dignity and grace, walked
over to where Houston stood by the fire, with dreamy,
thoughtful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston,&rdquo; said she, in low, sweet tones, &ldquo;Miss
Gladden has told me of your kindness toward me to-day,
and though she has thanked you for us both, yet I
wish to thank you personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Maverick,&rdquo; he replied in his grave, gentle manner,
&ldquo;you are more than welcome to any kindness I can
do for you, but do not thank me for what I did to-day;
that was nothing, I would have been a beast not to have
done that little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could know,&rdquo; she said, earnestly, &ldquo;how rare
such kindness and protection have been in my past life,
you would realize that it does not seem like &lsquo;nothing&rsquo; to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Houston, Lyle seemed much less mature than Miss
Gladden, and though he had been quick to observe the
added charm in her manner that evening, still she seemed
to him little more than a child. Her words, and something
in the expression of those star-like eyes, touched
him deeply, and taking her hands in his, he answered
tenderly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I am very sorry for the loneliness of
your past life, and I want you, from this time, to regard
me as a brother, and if there should be any way in which
I could protect you, or help you, do not hesitate to tell
me freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time in all those weary years within her
recollection, Lyle went to her rest that night with a
heart satisfied; for as yet, only the surface of her affections
had been stirred, and the hidden depths below were
still unfathomed, awaiting the influence of some mightier
power.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII' id='CHAPTER_XIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>The snow-storm detained Mr. Blaisdell in the city
rather longer than he intended, and Houston had improved
the time in going over all the old books and office
records which were available.</p>
<p>The books of the company he could examine at his
leisure, on some pretext or other, in Morgan&rsquo;s presence,
but his extra work, which had occupied his evenings,
consisted in going over the old letter files, mining reports
and assay statements, making copies of whatever
he found that would be of value to him later. He had
found evidence of fraudulent transactions in the books
of the company, and of these he had made careful memoranda,
but so far, the greatest amount of evidence which
he had secured, had been discovered in the old letters
written by Mr. Blaisdell to other members of the company
at Silver City, and received by him in return. These
were copied exactly into a set of small books which he
had brought for that purpose, and he had also made
tracings and blue print copies of plats and maps of the
most important mines, and of the plans of their underground
workings.</p>
<p>What he now particularly desired was some turn of
affairs that would necessitate his visiting the mines, and
give him an opportunity to become familiar with their
workings, and that, in some way, he could gain access
to the books and papers of the main office at Silver City,
as he would there find records of the business transacted
directly with the company in New York. He had
taken the precaution to bring with him copies of letters
on file in the New York offices, but he now felt that
much of the most important evidence was contained in
the office at Silver City, and was the missing link which
he would need before going much farther, and as he sat
at his desk one bright morning, a few days after the
storm, mentally reviewing the whole situation, he was
planning how he could best secure this also.</p>
<p>Morgan, still carrying a few scars, sat with his legs
crossed on top of his table, reading a newspaper, when
the door opened, and Mr. Blaisdell entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, good-morning,&rdquo; was his greeting, as he
glanced quickly around the office, and Morgan&rsquo;s feet
suddenly descended to the floor. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with your eye, Morgan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, been sparring a little, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been down to the mines this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not yet; I thought maybe you&rsquo;d be up and
want to give some directions before I went down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very considerate!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Blaisdell sarcastically,
&ldquo;you know I would come to the mines myself,
anyway, and could give directions there just as well as
here. Get ready to go down there with me, I&rsquo;m going
in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going over to Houston&rsquo;s desk, he glanced hastily over
the books, gave some instructions, and saying that he
wished to see him later, went out to join Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan, how did you get that eye?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Houston and I had a little set-to the other day,
and he hit me pretty hard, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it about?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Blaisdell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; answered Morgan, carelessly, &ldquo;we
had some words about that girl of Maverick&rsquo;s; I guess
he&rsquo;s a little stuck on her himself, and was afraid I&rsquo;d be
in his way, or something of the kind; I got mad and hit
him, or tried to, and he gave me a knock-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that he doesn&rsquo;t look as though you
had hit him very hard,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Blaisdell dryly,
and then continued, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see the use of coming
to blows over Maverick&rsquo;s girl, or any other for that
matter, they&rsquo;re not so scarce as all that. Jim&rsquo;s girl has
got a pretty face, but she isn&rsquo;t worth fighting about, that
I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were reasons for Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s superior indifference
to Lyle&rsquo;s attractions, as she had been compelled
more than once, in a most emphatic manner, to
check attempts at undue familiarity on his part, notwithstanding
the fact that he was a much-married man,
living with his third wife, his table surrounded with
&ldquo;olive plants&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;fifteen in number&ndash;&ndash;of all sizes and descriptions,
and regarded in the bosom of his family as a
model husband and father.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, Mr. Blaisdell returned to the
office, looking very weary and somewhat worried. Morgan
remained at the mines the rest of the day. Mr.
Blaisdell went over the books with Houston, and after
expressing considerable satisfaction at the work which
he had accomplished, he sat down by himself, and
seemed lost in thought for some time. At last he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston, I&rsquo;ve been thinking for some time that
we need a little extra help in the office at Silver City, and
yet not enough that it has seemed advisable to employ
another bookkeeper. Our books there are getting behind,
and a little mixed, too, I&rsquo;m afraid. Mr. Lewis, our
bookkeeper, is quite an old man, and he has charge of two
or three sets of books for the different companies, and
it is not to be wondered at if he occasionally gets a little
confused; and it occurred to me while sitting here,
that perhaps you might be willing to come down, for a
day or two, and straighten out the books for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston seemed for a moment to be weighing the
matter very deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I could do it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but it would involve
considerable extra time and expense for me, and
I would want extra compensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; responded Mr. Blaisdell, readily, &ldquo;I
understand that; indeed, I was going to remark that
you have already accomplished so much work, and your
methods seem to be so exact and, at the same time, expeditious,
that we will consider your term of probation
here at an end; we agreed to raise your salary at the
end of the month, if your services were satisfactory;
they are eminently so, and I will take the responsibility
of paying you one hundred and twenty-five dollars for
this first month also. As to your fare back and forth
between here and Silver City, of course we will pay
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Houston, smiling and inwardly congratulating
himself, &ldquo;I do not see but that it is settled that
I go to Silver City whenever you are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;you will not need
to go down there for ten days or so, as the time will make
no appreciable difference in the state of affairs there,
and I shall need you here during that time, as some
parties are coming out from the east to look at some
mining properties, and both Morgan and myself will
probably have to spend most of our time at the mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening, at the boarding house, Houston sat apparently
interested in a game of chess between Miss
Gladden and Rutherford, but in reality, paying close attention
to a conversation carried on in low tones between
Mr. Blaisdell and Morgan. Only an occasional sentence
was audible, but he could gather enough to satisfy himself
regarding the nature of their plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean the rubbish out of the shaft, and set a couple
of men to work there for a day or two,&rdquo; Mr. Blaisdell
was saying; a few words were lost, and then he said,
&ldquo;Whenever I hear what day they are coming up, we&rsquo;ll
put on a good force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have their own expert with them, I suppose?&rdquo;
asked Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;but if he&rsquo;s like the
most of those eastern experts, Haight and I can fix him
very easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later the conversation ended, Mr. Blaisdell saying,
as he rose to go to his room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a confoundedly poor property, but I think a few
tons of ore from the Yankee Boy will sell it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark gave Houston considerable food for reflection,
as the Yankee Boy was one of the richest properties
owned by the New York company. He had that
day received his first letter from his uncle, in New York,
sent under cover of an envelope from the Chicago firm,
and written in reply to a letter from himself mailed immediately
upon his arrival at the mines; and Mr. Blaisdell
and Morgan having left, Houston retired to his room
to make his first report of the information he had secured
and seemed likely to secure, concerning the ways and
means of the western mining company; leaving the
chess players deep in their game, and Lyle watching
them.</p>
<p>Lyle, though keeping up her studies afternoons, had
not been down to Jack&rsquo;s cabin since the evening he had
shown her the picture, partly on account of the storm,
and partly because she feared her father might be watching
her.</p>
<p>Jack had wondered at her absence, thinking perhaps
her new friends had something to do with it; but on this
night, Jack had other company, as Bull-dog had ensconced
himself in Mike&rsquo;s chair beside the stove, and
having also appropriated Mike&rsquo;s briar pipe,&ndash;&ndash;its owner
being absent,&ndash;&ndash;was smoking with all the gravity and
self-possession of an old-timer, and entertaining Jack
with his quaint talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said at last, clasping his hands about his
knee, and holding the pipe between his teeth, &ldquo;have ye
seen that new feller up at the orfice. Mister Houston,
they call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack replied, very indifferently, that he had seen him
once or twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, he&rsquo;s a Joe-dandy, a regular cracker-jack;
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ter be boss of that whole shootin&rsquo; match,
Morgan an&rsquo; that little, black, snaky feller, an&rsquo; old Blaisdell,
too, if he don&rsquo;t look out fer hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; asked Jack, much
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, I know it. He&rsquo;s got more sand than
all the rest of &rsquo;em put together, an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t afraid of nobody.
&rsquo;D ye hear &rsquo;bout that fight that him &rsquo;n Morgan
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, did they fight?&rdquo; inquired Jack, much surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they fight!&rdquo; exclaimed the little Arab, removing
the pipe from his mouth, and shaking his head with evident
satisfaction at the remembrance of the scene, &ldquo;well,
I should smile! Morgan, he tried hard enough ter fight,
but the other feller did him up in &rsquo;bout the sixteenth part
of a second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you there?&rdquo; asked Jack, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was peekin&rsquo; through a crack in the door; they
s&rsquo;posed I&rsquo;d gone, but I see somethin&rsquo; was up when Mister
Houston first come in, an&rsquo; I just makes up my mind
I&rsquo;ll see the fun through, an&rsquo; when I goes out, I bangs the
door hard, and then opens it agin, careful like, and peeks
in; an&rsquo; Mister Houston, he had walked over ter where
Morgan was, an&rsquo; had lit into him &rsquo;bout somethin&rsquo; or
ruther he&rsquo;d ben sayin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; if he didn&rsquo;t lay down the
law ter him, I&rsquo;ll eat my hat. An&rsquo; then Morgan he sets
out to give him some of his lip, and by Jiminy! &rsquo;fore he
could spit the words out, biff! comes a stunner right in
his face, and shut one eye. My, wasn&rsquo;t he mad though!
Then he goes ter give the other feller a punch in the
head, an&rsquo; Houston, he ducked the purtiest ye ever see,
and let out a blow at Morgan&rsquo;s jaw, an&rsquo; gee-whizz!
Morgan goes a flying across the room, and lan&rsquo;s under
the big desk, and he never come to fer &rsquo;bout twenty minits.
My, but &rsquo;twas the slickest knock-out ye ever see,
Corbett couldn&rsquo;t a done it slicker hisself! an&rsquo; I rolled
down them steps a laughin&rsquo; so I &rsquo;most died. I went
back after he&rsquo;d come to, an&rsquo; Mister Houston was a tellin&rsquo;
him ter come out an&rsquo; fight, but he didn&rsquo;t seem ter
wan&rsquo;ter very bad, an&rsquo; I see the fun was over, so I come
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had laughed heartily over Bull-dog&rsquo;s description
of the scene; now he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the fight about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bull-dog, gravely replacing his pipe in
his mouth, &ldquo;&rsquo;s near &rsquo;s I could make out, &rsquo;twas &rsquo;bout
some girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What girl?&rdquo; inquired Jack, rather quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the new feller, he didn&rsquo;t call no names, but I
heerd Morgan say somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout Lyle Maverick, an&rsquo;
so I guess &rsquo;twas her, but I knew you was always kinder
sweet on her yourself, an&rsquo; so I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter say nothin&rsquo;,
&rsquo;cause, &rsquo;nless you&rsquo;re a scrapper, you won&rsquo;t stand no
sort of a chance with that feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bull-dog,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m something of a
&lsquo;scrapper&rsquo; myself, but I don&rsquo;t expect to get into any
trouble;&rdquo; the tone was kind, and he spoke with a half
smile, but the keenly observant eyes of the boy detected
a shade on Jack&rsquo;s face. However, all conversation was
suddenly checked by the entrance of Mike, who, in a
manner more forcible than ceremonious, dispossessed
Bull-dog of his chair and pipe. The little waif soon took
his departure, but it was some time before the cloud on
Jack&rsquo;s brow was dispelled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>For the next day or two, Houston saw very little of
either Mr. Blaisdell or Morgan, as they spent most of
their time at the mines, but his own work was greatly
increased, as copies of mining reports regarding the
Sunrise mine, and duplicate sets of statements of the
assay values of samples of ore taken from its various
shafts, were to be made out with the greatest care.
There were tracings and blue prints to be made from the
original plats, by which it was to be shown that the vein
of the Sunrise mine was but an extension of that of the
Morning Star, one of the famous North Star group of
mines; and there were also very important and strictly
confidential letters to be written, under Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s
directions, to the Silver City office, more particularly to
Mr. Rivers, the secretary of the company, whom Houston
had not yet seen.</p>
<p>The Sunrise mine which was suddenly looming up
into such prominence, was one of which Houston had
never heard, but judging from the rich samples of ore
produced, and the testimony of experts and assayers, it
seemed to be one of the most valuable properties in that
locality; but to Houston, situated as he was, behind the
scenes, it only afforded an additional glimpse of the
business methods of the company.</p>
<p>As he still sat at his desk, having just completed his
day&rsquo;s work, Morgan came in and threw himself down
heavily into a chair, taking his favorite attitude, with his
feet crossed on the table, and his hands clasped behind
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look tired, Morgan,&rdquo; commented Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;too tired to breathe if I
wasn&rsquo;t obliged to; this has been a hard day&rsquo;s work, and
if old Blaisdell sells that mine, as he expects to, he&rsquo;ll
have to divy up pretty liberally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston turned around facing Morgan, with a peculiar
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sunrise mine seems to have developed wonderfully
within the past few days,&rdquo; he remarked quietly.</p>
<p>Morgan laughed; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think so,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if
you could have seen it four days ago. There hasn&rsquo;t been
a day&rsquo;s work done on it for over a year; some of it had
caved in, and even the main shaft was pretty well filled
up with rubbish. Now that&rsquo;s all cleaned out, and the
few places where there is any quantity of ore in sight
show up to good advantage, and we&rsquo;ve hauled eight
or ten tons of ore from the Yankee Boy down onto the
dump, so it makes a pretty respectable showing. Oh,
the boss is a cuckoo for any job of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the mining company own the Yankee Boy?&rdquo;
asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Morgan, &ldquo;that whole group of mines
is owned by a set of New Yorkers; this company out
here is their agent, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And New Yorkers are not supposed to know all the
ins and outs of their western agent&rsquo;s mining deals,&rdquo;
commented Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say not! There&rsquo;s a good many things
going on that they are not supposed to know about,
and that they wouldn&rsquo;t be very likely to get onto, either,
some of &rsquo;em, even if they were right on the ground.
Some of those ducks are pretty green, and fellows like
Blaisdell or Rivers can make them believe most anything.
If Blaisdell was half as smart as he makes some
of those eastern fellows think he is, he would have been
a rich man before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Houston, in surprise, &ldquo;Blaisdell is quite
well off, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s only answer was a significant shake of the
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, he is not worth a dollar,&rdquo; answered Morgan,
&ldquo;every nickle&rsquo;s worth of property that he ever had, that
he hasn&rsquo;t lost outright, has been put into the hands of his
wife, or his sons, or somebody or other, heaven knows
who, I don&rsquo;t, nor nobody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am surprised,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;he seems
shrewd and sharp in business matters, and I supposed
he was a rich man. He must have made considerable
money, what has become of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan shrugged his shoulders; &ldquo;Have you seen old
Rivers yet?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secretary? No, I&rsquo;ve never met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Morgan, &ldquo;you probably will, in a
day or two, he&rsquo;ll be likely to come up with the eastern
party; and when you&rsquo;ve seen him, you&rsquo;ve seen the biggest
rascal, and at the same time the slickest duck there
is on this side of the divide, and I doubt if there&rsquo;s any on
the other side can beat him. Old Blaisdell&rsquo;s pretty
smooth, but he ain&rsquo;t a circumstance to Rivers. Rivers
will rob you of your last dollar, and make you think he&rsquo;s
your best friend all the time. Oh, he&rsquo;s a lulu, and no
mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further conversation was prevented by the entrance
of Mr. Blaisdell, with a fine lot of ore samples with their
assay values attached, which he arranged on his desk,
his thin lips drawn back meanwhile in his accustomed
self-satisfied smile. When this was done, he turned to
the young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, with a low chuckle of delight, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got word my party is coming all right. Haight just got
a telegram from Rivers, that Winters had wired him that
he and his son and the expert would be in Silver City,
on to-morrow&rsquo;s train, so I will have to go back to the
city to-night, to be in readiness to meet them. Let me
see, this is Wednesday, they arrive Thursday; Morgan,
set the men to work on that mine Friday morning; we
will be up here in the course of the forenoon, you see
that everything is in first-class order. Houston, are
those statements and tracings all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, put them up as quick as you can, I&rsquo;ll take
them to the city with me, and the team will be here in
half a minute; I want to catch that six o&rsquo;clock train. I
didn&rsquo;t expect to have to go to-night, but that telegram
has hurried up matters. Morgan, you keep everything
straight to-morrow, and be ready for us Friday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I send a team down?&rdquo; asked Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no matter about that, I&rsquo;ll take Joe Hunt&rsquo;s team
there at the Y, it will be a rather more stylish turnout
than one of the mining teams. Everything is here O.K.
I suppose,&rdquo; as Houston handed him the papers he had
requested, &ldquo;all right, there&rsquo;s my team; well, so long,
boys, don&rsquo;t get into any more fights while I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo;
and he was soon rattling down the canyon toward the
Y, while Houston and Morgan began to make preparations
for closing the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan, as he stood looking out of the
window, and waiting for Houston to put away his books
and papers for the night, &ldquo;I can just imagine the little
scene that will be enacted down there at the main office
to-morrow, it would be as good as a play just to watch
it. There will be old Wilson, with his diamonds and
palaver, expatiating on the country and the mines; and
Blaisdell, with that dignified way of his, talking of nitrates
and sulphides, and so many milligrams equaling
so many grains troy, and so many gramestons in so
many pounds avoirdupois, and all that razzle-dazzle, and
Rivers, not saying much of anything, but smiling, and
calculating how many thousands he is going to put in
his own pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston laughed, and was about to reply, when Rutherford
came in, as he often walked down to meet Houston
and accompany him to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Ned,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;you should have
been here a minute ago; Morgan has been giving some
verbal portraits of the mining company. Your descriptive
powers are excellent, Morgan, and you seem to
know these men pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know them,&rdquo; said Morgan, swinging himself astride
a chair and folding his arms upon the back, while Rutherford
perched upon a large writing table, and Houston
leaned against his long desk, with his arms folded,
&ldquo;Know them, I should think I ought to. I worked in
the Silver City office as bookkeeper for a year before
coming out here, and six months of that time I boarded
in Blaisdell&rsquo;s family; and as his wife hates Rivers&rsquo; wife,
and couldn&rsquo;t say enough about her, I knew about as
much of one family as the other before I came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Blaisdell try to impress his better half with
a sense of his intellectual superiority, as he does the
rest of his fellow mortals?&rdquo; asked Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he ever did,&rdquo; answered Morgan, &ldquo;he must have
got bravely over it some time ago; she treats him with
a contempt that would have cured him of that habit.
I&rsquo;ve sometimes thought that the reason he swells so
much out among people is because he&rsquo;s so unmercifully
snubbed at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;just a natural effort to keep
his self-respect in equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he many children?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;not many, only fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only fifteen!&rdquo; said Houston, in astonishment, while
Rutherford exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, come off now, you&rsquo;re joking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No joking about it,&rdquo; said Morgan seriously, &ldquo;I took
the old man&rsquo;s word for it. I tried several times to count
&rsquo;em, but had to give it up, it seemed that every day I saw
a new one. Some of &rsquo;em are as old as I; you see this is
his third wife, and some of the children are older than
she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a wife younger
than my children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to,&rdquo; replied Morgan, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re as spooney
as can be, when they&rsquo;re not quarreling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, deliver me!&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
hear any more about them. How about that other man,
Rivers? He hasn&rsquo;t such a surplus of children and wives,
has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan slowly, &ldquo;I guess if his children
could all be got together, there&rsquo;d be more of &rsquo;em than
of Blaisdell&rsquo;s, and he has full as many wives, only, in
his case, they are all living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;is he a Mormon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan shook his head, and Houston said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan, I think in your efforts to be entertaining,
you are drawing slightly on your imagination, thinking
that we are fresh enough to believe anything you choose
to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s all true, whether you believe it or not. That
man left a wife and family of children somewhere in New
York State, more than ten years ago, and ran away with
another woman; they have five or six children, and
here, about three years ago, since I came here, he got his
divorce from the first woman, and married this one.
Then he spent last winter in San Francisco, and it seems
now, that he circulated around there under another
name,&ndash;&ndash;and his name is no more Rivers, than mine is
Jenks,&ndash;&ndash;and passed himself off for an unmarried man,
and now there&rsquo;s a woman there has entered suit against
him, for breach of promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rutherford, descending from his elevated
position, &ldquo;I move that we adjourn to the boarding house
at once; if I hear any more such stuff, I&rsquo;ll lose my appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery to me is,&rdquo; said Houston, when they
were started on their way to the house, &ldquo;how such a
man is allowed to live and do business in a respectable
community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Morgan carelessly, &ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t any worse
than the rest of &rsquo;em, only he&rsquo;s a little more out and out
with it; and the rest of &rsquo;em know it, and as long as they
all live in glass houses, they don&rsquo;t any of &rsquo;em want to
throw any stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve found &rsquo;em all about alike, men and women
too, for that matter, though I believe you shut me off
from expressing my views about women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you certainly would not include all women in
such an assertion?&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not, as far as my experience goes,
they&rsquo;re all off the same piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; said Houston indignantly, &ldquo;what are
you talking about? You had a mother once, you do not
mean to traduce her memory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Morgan was silent, then he replied in
a tone that sounded very unlike his usual voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a mother once, and that is what has made
me what I am; sometime I will tell you about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And nothing more was said until they reached the
house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>
<p>Friday morning, word was received from Mr. Blaisdell,
over the private wire connecting the office at Silver
City with the mines, that he and Mr. Rivers would
be up on the first train with a party of four, and to have
everything in readiness for them; also to make arrangements
for their accommodation at the boarding house.
Morgan had already placed a small force of men at work
on the mine, and after carrying out Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s instructions,
remained himself at the mine, superintending
the work.</p>
<p>It was one of those perfect days, so frequent among
the mountains; a cloudless sky, and the air so clear
that one could see the most distant mountain peaks with
wonderful distinctness. The weather was again warm,
yet the air was cool and invigorating, and aromatic with
the breath of the evergreen forests clothing the sides
of the mountains and foot hills, while everywhere, the
spring flowers were adding their color and beauty to the
scene, their fragrance rising continuously, like an invisible
cloud of incense, on every hand.</p>
<p>At about eleven o&rsquo;clock, Houston heard the noise of
the approaching team, and stepping to the window, saw
a three-seated, open wagon, drawn by a pair of powerful
horses. On the back seat, with Mr. Blaisdell, was an old
gentleman, evidently Mr. Winters, and on the second
seat, facing them, were two whom Houston judged to
be Mr. Rivers and the junior Mr. Winters; but he took
little notice of them, for his attention was arrested by
one of the two young men sitting on the front seat, with
the driver. The figure looked wonderfully familiar, but
the face was almost wholly concealed by a broad-brimmed,
soft hat. The team stopped, and at once the
passengers prepared to alight; the hat was suddenly
pushed back, revealing to the astonished Houston, the
shining spectacles and laughing face of Arthur Van
Dorn, his college class mate and chum.</p>
<p>The men were alighting, and it was evident that Mr.
Blaisdell was in a most genial frame of mind, he fairly
beamed on every one; but Houston, not waiting to meet
him, made a hasty retreat into the back room, to decide
quickly upon his course of action. Nearly a thousand
plans occurred to him, but none seemed feasible. If
Mr. Blaisdell were the only member of the firm present,
he felt he would have little difficulty, but the presence
of Mr. Rivers made it considerably harder for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the front room, Mr. Blaisdell was receiving
his guests in the most effusive manner, reminding
Houston, even in his dilemma, of a gushing school
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters, let me assist you, you must be exceedingly
weary; here, take this chair, you will find it a little
more comfortable; sorry not to have more luxurious
quarters in which to receive you, but this is the wild
west, you know. Mr. Rivers, won&rsquo;t you see that Mr.
Winters is comfortable, while I wait on his son. Mr.
Lindlay, let me show you these specimens of ore, I think
you will appreciate them as few can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all this effusion, Mr. Rivers suddenly
appeared in the back room. He was a small man, quite
bald, with small, twinkling, peering eyes, and a quick
motion of his head from one side to the other that reminded
Houston of a ferret. Seeing Houston, his eyes
twinkled until they nearly closed, he smiled, and extending
his hand, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the new clerk, Mr. Houston, I suppose; very
glad to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Mr. Blaisdell entered; &ldquo;Well, Mr.
Rivers, you have found Mr. Houston, I see; Mr. Houston,
this is Mr. Rivers, the secretary of the company. I
was just looking for you, Houston, I want you to come
in and meet the people in the other room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment, Mr. Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;but
first, will you and Mr. Rivers just look over something
I have found here. This looks to me as though a serious
error had been made in this report regarding the Sunrise
mine, and as you will probably need it to-day, had it
better not be corrected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Error in the report of the Sunrise!&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell,
adjusting his spectacles, &ldquo;let me see; why yes, that
is an error, and a bad one, too, I am glad you called our
attention to it; look here, Rivers,&rdquo; and the two men
were deeply engrossed in a study of the papers before
them.</p>
<p>Houston improved the opportunity to reconnoiter the
situation in the front room. Mr. Winters and his son
were in a close consultation. The third man was busily
engaged in looking at some ores, his back towards the
door, while beside him stood Van Dorn, indifferently
watching him. Houston gave a slight cough that attracted
Van Dorn&rsquo;s attention; he turned, and seeing
Houston, his face brightened, and he was about to
spring forward to greet him, when the latter, with a
quick motion of his hand, gave him the signal of their
old college days, its equivalent in the western vernacular
being, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me away,&rdquo; at the same time putting
his finger on his lips. A look of intense surprise flashed
across Van Dorn&rsquo;s face, but he grasped the situation at
once, and silently giving the return signal, he turned
and walked in the opposite direction with the most nonchalant
manner imaginable, and Houston knew that his
secret was safe. A few moments afterward, &ldquo;Mr. Houston,
our private secretary,&rdquo; was introduced to the entire
party, and a hearty grip from Van Dorn&rsquo;s hand, which
Houston returned with interest, was the only sign of
mutual recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well friends,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, blandly, having
looked at his watch, &ldquo;it is now so near noon, that when
we have allowed Mr. Winters ample time for rest, we
had better proceed to the house and have our dinner,
before going to the mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dine at noon,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winters, in a very
genial, yet dignified manner, &ldquo;there is scarcely time for
a very extended exploration, but don&rsquo;t discommode
yourselves in the least, gentlemen, on account of my age
and feebleness. I have always enjoyed perfect health,
and notwithstanding my gray hairs, I don&rsquo;t believe I
am much older than my friend, here, Mr. Blaisdell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not older than I am, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Blaisdell,
who prided himself upon his youthful appearance, &ldquo;why,
how old do you take me to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much older than you look,&rdquo; replied Mr. Winters, &ldquo;I
am sixty-five, and you are at least sixty, although you
look ten years younger than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have certainly proven yourself a Yankee by
your guessing,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, slightly disconcerted,
while the others joined in a general laugh at his expense,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought you would have made
so good a guess as that, neither did I think you were so
near my own age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the advantage of me now,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Winters, pleasantly, &ldquo;but if we live twenty years, as I
expect to, I&rsquo;ll then look younger than you, for I have
the better health of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever visited the west before, Mr. Winters?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Rivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a few times,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, while
the mining expert, an Englishman, with large blue eyes,
full face and blond mustache, smiled quietly at Van
Dorn and Houston, who were seated near each other;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been west once or twice a year for the last ten
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, with considerable surprise,
while the younger Mr. Winters said with a laugh, &ldquo;Oh,
you couldn&rsquo;t keep father at home in New York, any
more than you could one of these Indians out here; he&rsquo;s
got to be roaming around all over the country continually.
If he didn&rsquo;t drag me about with him everywhere,
I wouldn&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been out in this country often, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Mr. Blaisdell, addressing the expert, who replied
coolly, with a very slight accent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I simply come out &rsquo;ere once in a w&rsquo;ile, you
know, just as an accommodation to Mr. Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live in New York, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; my &rsquo;ome is in London,&rdquo; he replied, with an
air that seemed to indicate he did not care for any further
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, &ldquo;I thought you said
something some time ago, about dinner; if the ride in
the mountain air has given the rest of these gentlemen
such an appetite as it has me, we would like to see that
dinner materialize before very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way to the boarding house, Van Dorn managed
to walk with Houston, and exclaimed in a low
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Everard, what does this mean? What
are you masquerading around in this style for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain now, there are too many
around; after dinner we will go down by ourselves, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story. I may want a little advice
from you, as you&rsquo;re a mining expert yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let any of these people out here know that,&rdquo;
Van Dorn answered quickly; &ldquo;Mr. Winters has introduced
me as an inventor of some mining machinery that
they use, just out here looking around for the pleasure
of it; you know I did invent an amalgamator that is
being used to some extent; but I&rsquo;m not supposed to
know anything about practical mining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston laughed; &ldquo;How about the Englishman?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no fool,&rdquo; said Van Dorn quickly, &ldquo;though he is
playing verdant; only comes out here to accommodate
Mr. Winters, and so forth; that&rsquo;s all right, but he accommodates
Mr. Winters pretty often. He&rsquo;s a fine expert
and understands his business thoroughly, only I
happen to be a little more familiar with the ores in this
locality, as I spent a good many months out here in the
mountains two years ago, experting mines; not in this
camp of course, but only a few miles from here. Mr.
Winters himself is sharp, and with Lindlay and myself
out here, he&rsquo;s not going to be very badly taken in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;and now there is one thing
more before we get to the house. You remember Morton
Rutherford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mort Rutherford, of old college days? well, I should
say so; what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His brother is stopping here, you will see him at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; interrupted Van Dorn, &ldquo;little Ned? What
under heaven is he doing out here? Are you two fellows
out here incognito making love to rustic maidens?
or what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ned is out here in his own name, you won&rsquo;t need
be under any restrictions with him, but what I want to
say is this: Don&rsquo;t let him know who I am, or that you
used to know me, or that I know his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else I&rsquo;m not to let him know?&rdquo; queried
Van Dorn, taking out a small note book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, put up your book, or Mr. Blaisdell will think I
am giving you pointers on the mine. But this is how it
is; Rutherford met me on the train coming out here, introduced
himself to me, took a fancy to the mountains,
and decided to stay a few weeks. He thinks I am&ndash;&ndash;what
you found me&ndash;&ndash;the clerk for this company, and my
home in Chicago. I am not ready to explain matters to
him yet, so just simply appear as if you had never met
me or heard of me till to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it Ned didn&rsquo;t know you? Didn&rsquo;t you ever
see him when you visited Mort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was there only once, and he was away at school
at the time, and then he never went to Yale, you know,
he is a Harvard graduate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; all right, I&rsquo;ll be mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp turn in the road brought the house into view,
with Rutherford seated on the porch, reading a magazine.</p>
<p>He glanced up with his usual assumption of dignity,
as the party approached, but catching sight of Van
Dorn, at the rear of the little procession, his magazine
and his dignity were suddenly flung to the winds, and he
bounded down from the porch like a school-boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! Hello there, Van Dorn, how do you do?
Great Scott! how did you ever come out here? I&rsquo;m
awfully glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very glad to see you, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Van Dorn,
heartily, &ldquo;but the mystery to me is, how do you happen
to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell looked on greatly astonished and
amused by Rutherford&rsquo;s impetuous greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Rutherford,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you seem to
have met an old friend; ah, yes, I see, you are from Boston,
and so is Mr. Van Dorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Introductions followed, and the party sat down to
dinner. Houston, seated between Van Dorn and Rutherford,
did not lack for entertainment, but he had been
at the table but a few seconds when he became aware
that Miss Gladden was not there. He waited till the
meal was nearly over, and then quietly inquired of Lyle
whether Miss Gladden were ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Lyle answered, in a low tone, &ldquo;Miss Gladden
thought best, as so many gentlemen were to be
here, and on business, to let them have the table to themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner, Houston started a little early for the
office, and Van Dorn took his hat, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, gentlemen, I&rsquo;ll walk down with
Mr. Houston. You know I&rsquo;m not so crazy on mining as
you are, and I&rsquo;d like to see somebody for a change, that
can talk on some other subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll want
to go through the mines in our company, though, by
and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I probably will have to go in your company, if I go
at all,&rdquo; Van Dorn replied carelessly, &ldquo;my choice is rather
limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be here this evening, won&rsquo;t you Van?&rdquo; said
Rutherford, who was then engaged in a sort of one-sided
conversation with the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Van Dorn answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; Rutherford responded.</p>
<p>The confidential clerk and the young inventor strolled
down the road together, and the officers of the mining
company never dreamed of the results.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Mr. Blaisdell and Mr. Rivers rose
to return to the office, and the others followed their example,
with the exception of Mr. Winters, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you boys are in a hurry to start, all right, go
ahead; I&rsquo;m going to take my after-dinner smoke out
here on the porch,&rdquo; at the same time producing a fine
meerschaum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, father, don&rsquo;t you get left behind,&rdquo; said his son
jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get left, you young rattle-brains! I&rsquo;ll have my
smoke out and be down there at the office, before you
are ready to start; your old father generally &lsquo;gets there&rsquo;
in as good time as you can make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will do, Mr. Winters,&rdquo; said Mr.
Blaisdell, &ldquo;the road to the mine branches off just below
here, and we can just as well drive around here and call
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Blaisdell, that will be perfectly satisfactory,
whatever suits you young fellows, suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Mr. Winters,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell,
&ldquo;we &lsquo;young fellows&rsquo; will be along in the course of half
an hour,&rdquo; and they went down the canyon, leaving the
old gentleman in the low porch, deep in the enjoyment of
his pipe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>As the quondam class-mates disappeared together
down the winding road, Houston gave his friend, as
succinctly as possible, an explanation of his presence
there in the capacity of clerk, briefly outlining his plans,
and stating what he had been able so far to accomplish.</p>
<p>Van Dorn was intensely interested, and through his
own practical knowledge and experience, was able to
give Houston some valuable information, and to make
some important suggestions.</p>
<p>Houston was quick to see that here was just the help
he would need a little later; he also knew that opportunities
for seeing his friend would be limited, he must
act promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; he asked rather abruptly, &ldquo;how soon do you
go east?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any special engagements for this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing particularly important at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember my uncle, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Mr. Cameron perfectly, though I have
not seen him for a number of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, for a sufficient consideration, you would
come out here on business for us, at any time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Lindlay, &lsquo;just to accommodate,&rsquo; I suppose,&rdquo;
laughed Van Dorn, and continued, &ldquo;Everard, old boy,
I am at the service of yourself and your uncle, and we&rsquo;ll
say nothing about &lsquo;considerations&rsquo; until afterward; then
arrange it between yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not require your time and services without
ample compensation,&rdquo; returned Houston, &ldquo;but you will
be just the man I will need later; an expert, familiar
with this locality, in whom my uncle will repose perfect
confidence, and whom the company here will not suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Cameron may not place much confidence in
the harum-scarum sophomore that visited his home a
few years since, if he remembers him at all,&rdquo; said Van
Dorn, with a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word will be enough for that,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;I
will write a letter this afternoon for you to take to him.
There are the gentlemen now, coming down the road;
I will see you again this evening, and probably to-morrow.
I wonder what has become of Mr. Winters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he is taking his afternoon smoke,&rdquo; said
Van Dorn. &ldquo;I think the old gentleman would throw
up the whole mining deal rather than sacrifice that. After
what you&rsquo;ve told me of this mining concern out here,
I&rsquo;ve considerable curiosity to see this famous mine
they&rsquo;ve been writing about. I&rsquo;ve got an idea just about
how it will pan out, but I&rsquo;ll say nothing till I&rsquo;ve seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know your impressions, later,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; answered Van Dorn, and the party outside
having nearly reached the door, the subject was
dropped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Winters, seated in the rustic porch,
his attention divided between the picturesque scenery
surrounding him, and the spirals of blue smoke which
he loved to watch, was in no hurry to exchange his present
enjoyment for subterranean explorations; the rest
and solitude seemed doubly welcome after the last few
weeks of travel.</p>
<p>Rutherford, who lingered a few moments after the
others had gone, did not find him very socially inclined,
and picking up his magazine from the floor, where it had
reposed since Van Dorn&rsquo;s appearance, he started up the
canyon for a stroll among the rocks by the lake.</p>
<p>It is to be feared that Mr. Winters, under the combined
influence of his pipe and the warm sunshine, was
very nearly asleep. It is certain that he never heard the
sound of soft, trailing garments beside him, nor did he
appear to be in full possession of all his faculties, until
two arms rested lightly on his shoulders, and a pair of
small, white hands were clasped across his eyes.</p>
<p>Such a proceeding, under such circumstances, naturally
had the effect of very quickly restoring his faculties
to their normal condition, but on trying to turn his head,
he found it held as firmly as in a vise, by the hands which
had been quickly removed from his eyes, while a mischievous
voice announced imperiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess who it is, and you are free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess!&rdquo; exclaimed the old gentleman in some perplexity,
&ldquo;why, if I were at home, I would know this was
one of my little girl&rsquo;s tricks, but I cannot imagine who it
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a musical, rippling laugh, as the hands were
withdrawn, and Mr. Winters, turning quickly, came near
losing his pipe in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, Leslie! what does this mean? Well,
well! so it was my little girl after all, up to her old
tricks; but, child, how came you out here, in such a
place as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, Houston or Rutherford would
scarcely have recognized Miss Gladden, could they have
seen her seated beside Mr. Winters with all the careless
abandon of a child, laughing merrily in answer to his
numerous questions, while he playfully pinched her
cheek, or pulled her ear. To Mr. Winters, however, she
seemed like one of his own children, for Leslie Gladden
was an orphan, and Mr. and Mrs. Winters, having been
deeply attached to her parents, and having no daughter
of their own, had always regarded her as a daughter,
and much of her life had been passed in their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, puss,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters, having answered her
inquiries regarding his family, &ldquo;seems to me it&rsquo;s about
time you gave an account of yourself; what are you
doing here? and what have you been doing since last
Easter? and where are Helen and her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time, if you please, sir,&rdquo; said Miss
Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, giving the old man orders, as usual;
we always spoiled you, Leslie. Well, in the first place,
what possessed you to leave us in the way you did? We
understood you had gone to spend Easter with Helen;
and the next we heard, Helen wrote her sister that they
were going to spend the summer traveling in the west,
and that you were to accompany them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain that a little later; what is the next in
order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Helen here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, she and George are in Denver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is stopping here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one; do you think I need a guardian, or a chaperon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes twinkled; &ldquo;You always were an
independent sort of a girl, and pretty level-headed, too,
I must admit; but, my dear child, is it safe for you to be
out here alone among the miners, and this rough class
of people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden laughed; &ldquo;Did you see any very rough
people to-day at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, to be sure, I did not, but then, there must
be many of them out here in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never see them,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;I associate
only with the people you met to-day; no one here knows
that I have wealth; so really, I am safer here than at
home, where I am known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no society here,&rdquo; protested the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to get away from society; there is plenty
of refined and pleasant companionship, and if I have
friends here, I know they are sincere friends, not money
worshipers, or fortune hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters, &ldquo;the princess is out
here in disguise, seeking some knight who will love her
for herself alone, and not for her fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden gravely, &ldquo;I have not come
out here seeking for any knight, but to escape from a
base, dishonorable and cowardly knave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your cousin Humphrey been annoying you
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he and his mother made life a burden to me, that
was my reason for leaving home as I did. Humphrey
has sunk nearly every dollar of their property by his
profligacy, and now, he and his mother are determined
to have my fortune. Aunt exhausted all her stock of
melodramatic and sentimental language and her tears
in trying to get me to fulfill what she called my father&rsquo;s
&lsquo;dying wish,&rsquo; by marrying that debauchee and libertine;
then she tried threats, and finally became so wild with
rage, that she reminded me of the will, and told me I
should never marry any one else; that Humphrey
should have the property, as my father intended, sooner
or later, if not with me, then without me. I knew Helen
intended to come west, and I went to her and asked to
let me travel with them. Now, you know my reason for
leaving so suddenly, and for not writing. We have all
enjoyed our trip very much; you know George came
out on business, and when he was occupied, of course
it was pleasanter for Helen that I was with her. While
we were at St. Paul, George met some mining men, and
he immediately began to have symptoms of mining
fever, and hearing of the mines out here, he brought us
out, among the mountains and miners. We came out
when the weather was warm and delightful, and Helen
and I roamed over the mountains while George explored
the mines. Then he decided to go to Denver, and I
would probably have accompanied them, though I had
become attached to this place, but just then I heard that
my cousin had traced me to St. Paul, and was in pursuit,
to renew his attentions to me, so I decided to remain
here where he will be less likely to find me. Helen and
her husband are in Denver, sworn to secrecy regarding
my whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; exclaimed the old gentleman, meditatively,
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought your aunt would so far
have forgotten herself. It was unfortunate that your
father made such a will, leaving everything to Humphrey
in case of your dying unmarried, but that was
when you were both children, and he was very fond of
the little fellow. Leslie, my dear, I wish you were married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not, and perhaps never likely to be,&rdquo; Miss
Gladden answered merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you might have been married twenty times
over,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters, shaking his head, &ldquo;and my own
boy, Harry, among the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once is enough for me, papa dear,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden
lightly, yet in a more tender tone, &ldquo;when the right
one comes; but it could never have been Harry, any
more than his brother, Richard; you and mamma were
like parents to me, and the boys both seem like brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you found the right one, yet?&rdquo; asked the old
gentleman, watching her keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you, I am not looking for a knight,&rdquo; she
answered brightly, but the color deepened on her cheek,
&ldquo;if he ever comes, he must find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Winters noted the telltale flush, and slowly shaking
his head, remarked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Leslie, about the
advisability of leaving you here; you were always inclined
to be very philanthropic, and it would be like you
to adopt some young man out here, thinking you had
money enough for yourself and him, too; that clerk
down at the office, for instance, or this kid that was
prancing around in eye-glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;kid&rsquo; as you call him,&rdquo; Miss Gladden answered
demurely, &ldquo;has plenty of money of his own, and Mr.
Houston seems abundantly able to take care of himself;
if I adopt any one, it will be that beautiful girl who
waited on you at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, my dear?&rdquo; said the old gentleman,
brightening, &ldquo;I noticed that girl at the table to-day; she
is remarkably fine looking, and seemed to conduct herself
like a perfect lady; who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden, in her enthusiastic manner, began telling
him of Lyle, and of the interest she had taken in her,
but before she had proceeded very far, the team appeared
at the junction of the roads, the men calling Mr.
Winters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my stars, if there isn&rsquo;t the team!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;well my little girl, good-bye for the present, you will
see us both this evening,&rdquo; and having given Miss Gladden
a promise that neither he nor his son would betray
her secret, he hastened down the road to the waiting
team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he said, stopping to carefully empty the
ashes from his pipe on a projecting ledge of rock, &ldquo;I will
have to give you credit for being on hand very promptly;
that was about the shortest half hour that I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud, ringing laugh greeted this remark, which
caused Mr. Winters, who was replacing his pipe in its
case, to look up in mild wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on you, father,&rdquo; called his son, while Mr.
Blaisdell remarked, &ldquo;The time evidently has passed very
pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the origin of all this mirth?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Winters, as he seated himself with considerable dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, in explanation, &ldquo;to be because
you were so unconscious of the lapse of time; we
were delayed in getting together our papers, and it is
over an hour since we left the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked for you at every turn of the road,&rdquo; said his
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, &ldquo;I thought he had fallen
asleep over his pipe; I never dreamed he was disgracing
the whole crowd of us by such open flirtation as that,&ndash;&ndash;I
wish we had brought along a chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters very deliberately,
&ldquo;all I have to say is, that had you been in my
place, the time would have seemed equally short to you,
and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one of you but would have been
mighty glad to have been in my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winters,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;I begin to think
you&rsquo;re the youngest man of our party.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>With many jokes and much hilarity, the mining party
proceeded on their way. Arriving at the mines, they
found Morgan and Haight awaiting them, who were
duly introduced to the party, the English expert looking
at Haight with much the same expression with which a
mastiff might regard a rat terrier.</p>
<p>Everything being in readiness, they began the descent
of the long incline shaft, Mr. Blaisdell and Haight leading
the way with Mr. Lindlay, while Mr. Rivers followed
with Mr. Winters and his son and Van Dorn,
Morgan bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>It was nearly three hours before they reappeared at
the surface, and to a physiognomist, their faces, as they
emerged from the mouth of the shaft, would have furnished
an amusing study.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell looked irritated and annoyed, but jubilant.
He had been thoroughly disgusted by the conduct
of the English expert. Instead of taking Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s
word regarding the mine, corroborated as it was
by undisputable evidence in the shape of mining reports,
surveyor&rsquo;s notes, and maps, he had insisted on
ascertaining for himself the important data, the width,
dip and course of the vein, and the measurement of
various angles and distances, with a persistency and accuracy
that was simply exasperating. He also picked up
samples of ore in the most unexpected places which he
examined with the closest scrutiny. But having taken
his measurements and made his examinations, the results
were immediately jotted down in his note book,
and the samples dropped in his pockets, without a word,
which convinced Mr. Blaisdell that the expert knew
very little of his business, and was probably either doing
this to keep up appearances, or to gain a little information
for his own benefit. Not a word had been said contradicting
the statements he had made, not a question
raised implying any doubt of their correctness;&ndash;&ndash;evidently
they were just the kind of purchasers he wanted,
and his firmly set jaws and tightly compressed lips expressed
his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers scanned the company keenly with his ferret-like
glances; such unexpected acquiescence on their
part made him slightly suspicious and very watchful.
The thought uppermost in his mind was, &ldquo;Either these
people know absolutely nothing about mining, or they
know too much for our good.&rdquo; He had intended going
back to the city that evening, but he now decided to remain
over.</p>
<p>Mr. Winters, senior, reappeared, wearing the same expression
of benevolence and dignity with which he had
entered the mine. He seemed serenely unconscious of
the existence of deceit or fraud in business transactions
generally, and in mining negotiations in particular.
Only those well acquainted with him could detect from
the exaggerated twinkle of his eyes, that something had
more than ordinarily amused him.</p>
<p>Van Dorn and Lindlay had agreed before hand that
they would keep entirely separate, and each pursue his
own course of investigation independently of the other,&ndash;&ndash;Van
Dorn of course not being able to take any measurements,
as he was not supposed to be an expert,&ndash;&ndash;and
compare notes later. As the two emerged into daylight
and their eyes met, Van Dorn&rsquo;s laughing, blushing
face would have betrayed him, had any one known his
real business there, but a young inventor, exploring
mines just for the fun of the thing, is supposed to find
plenty of amusement. Under the big, blond mustache
of the Englishman, a pair of lips curled scornfully, and
his eyes rolled wildly for a moment, but that was all.</p>
<p>As the gentlemen gathered around the dump, the last
vestige of Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s irritation seemed to have disappeared,
as he blandly expatiated upon the quantity and
quality of the ore.</p>
<p>Van Dorn&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as he saw the shining lumps
from the Yankee Boy, and he and Lindlay exchanged
quick glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said the latter, quickly extracting
from his pocket a sample of the Sunrise ore and placing
it beside a piece taken at random from the dump; &ldquo;does
any one pretend to tell me that those are from the same
vein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a different class of ore altogether,&rdquo; replied Van
Dorn, &ldquo;such ore as that never would be found under the
conditions existing in that mine, but I&rsquo;ll be blest if I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to see the mine it did come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers had observed this little side conversation
and Van Dorn&rsquo;s close scrutiny of the samples, and was
at his side in a moment, inquiring in his smoothest tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that ore, Mr. Van Dorn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine ore, so far as I can judge,&rdquo; said Van Dorn
carelessly, &ldquo;I would like to see it run through that concentrator
and amalgamator of mine; if these men ever
get through talking about mines, Mr. Rivers, I must
get you and Mr. Blaisdell interested in my machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Mr. Lindlay, the party next paid
a visit to the Morning Star mine, that being the one
which Mr. Blaisdell had declared was on the same lead
as the Sunrise. This they found to be a valuable mine,
but there was not the slightest indication of the vein being
identical with that of the Sunrise, its strike carrying
it in a totally different direction, and its characteristics
being wholly dissimilar.</p>
<p>As it was too late for any further mining explorations,
the team was ordered, and preparations made for a return
to the house.</p>
<p>Lindlay and Van Dorn, by mutual agreement, started
up the canyon road together, in advance of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, where are you going?&rdquo; called Mr. Winters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to walk on ahead,&rdquo; answered Van Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as cheap to ride,&rdquo; said Mr. Winters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of room,&rdquo; added Mr. Blaisdell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait for you, you&rsquo;re too slow,&rdquo; laughed
Van Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give our places to those gentlemen,&rdquo; said Lindlay,
indicating Haight and Morgan, and with rather a painful
emphasis on the word &ldquo;gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he exclaimed a few moments later, &ldquo;Van
Dorn, what do you think of that for a mining proposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty tough, in fact, about the toughest I ever
saw,&rdquo; replied Van Dorn, &ldquo;but then, you remember we
got a hint at Silver City that they were sharpers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharpers!&rdquo; exclaimed Lindlay, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t call them
sharpers; I can admire a good, genuine piece of keen
rascality, don&rsquo;t you know, for I can play just as sharp
a game myself as the best of them, but w&rsquo;en it comes
to such downright, beastly work as this, so blundering
and bungling you know, w&rsquo;y it looks too much as
though they thought we were all born idiots, to be very
complimentary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it looks that way,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, laughing,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t look as though they had a very flattering
opinion of our acquirements, or our natural penetration,
if they suppose we can be gulled in this way.
They are about the worst set of mining sharks I&rsquo;ve ever
had the pleasure of meeting, and I shall tell Houston
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, that Mr. &rsquo;Uston seems a very decent sort
of a man,&rdquo; commented Lindlay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine fellow,&rdquo; responded Van Dorn warmly,
&ldquo;you see I know him, he&rsquo;s a friend of mine, but don&rsquo;t
say anything till we get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of yours! and w&rsquo;at in the deuce is he doing
out &rsquo;ere, among such a beastly lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is out on a piece of detective work on his own account,&rdquo;
and Van Dorn briefly gave Lindlay an outline
of what Houston had told him. A prolonged &ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;h&rdquo;
from Lindlay was the only response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d better tell you,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, &ldquo;for
fear you would include him in the lot out here, and be
down on him with the rest. He is a splendid fellow, and
I want you to know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; responded the Englishman, &ldquo;&rsquo;ere, give
&rsquo;im my card, and tell &rsquo;im I&rsquo;ll be very glad to &rsquo;elp &rsquo;im out
a bit any time if he needs it later, you know; I would
like to see &rsquo;im get the best of these fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell him,&rdquo; replied Van Dorn, &ldquo;he may give you
a letter of introduction to his uncle. They are all fine
people, and, as you say, I would like to see Houston
get the best of these rascals; I believe he will, too,
though he will have to lay low for a while yet, and there
may be some pretty dangerous work for him before he
gets through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pedestrians and the remainder of the party
reached the house at nearly the same time, the latter
having been slightly delayed in starting. Although a
little late, Houston and Rutherford, with Miss Gladden
and Lyle, were awaiting them in the porch. The rare
beauty of the two ladies elicited expressions of admiration
from both Lindlay and Van Dorn, the latter exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They evidently have some fine specimens of ladies
out here, and no mistake; there seems to be no fraud
in that direction. No wonder the old gentleman was so
indifferent as to whether we called for him or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden extended a welcome, both cordial and
graceful, to Mr. Winters and his son, and also to Van
Dorn, whom Rutherford introduced as an old friend.
Other introductions followed, and the entire company
entered the long, low dining room, whither Lyle had
already preceded them to see that everything was in perfect
readiness. Exclamations of surprise and pleasure
were heard on all sides, as the table had been tastefully
decorated by the skillful fingers of the ladies, with wild
flowers, and their beauty and fragrance filled the room.
A very social meal followed, interspersed with jokes and
repartee, and pleasant reminiscences. Toward the close,
Mr. Blaisdell entertained them with amusing sketches of
western life, and soon was relating some of his first mining
experiences, when he had just come from the east,
a newly fledged mining expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asked, in company with another expert, a western
man, much older than I, to examine some properties
for some mining men. They were all experienced miners,
old hands at the business, and they regarded me, a
young graduate from an eastern mining school, with no
practical knowledge that they knew of, as totally incompetent
to advise them, and, I think, invited me more out
of courtesy than anything else; perhaps also, out of
benevolent intention to give me an opportunity to learn
something about mines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evening previous to the day the examination
was to be made, they met for a little conversation regarding
the history of the mine, and to make plans for
the following day. Of course, our talk was principally
of mining in general. Well, didn&rsquo;t I play &lsquo;green&rsquo; that
evening. You can bet your sweet life that I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Lindlay elbowed Houston, who in turn nudged
Van Dorn. The last named gentleman telegraphed
across to the younger Winters and Rutherford, and
there seemed imminent danger of a general explosion;
however, Mr. Blaisdell thought it was all in appreciation
of his story, and blandly continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think when we broke up that night, the rest of
them must have wondered among themselves why they
had been such fools as to invite me. But I was only
anxious for the time to come to go down into that mine.
It was a property which the company had bought when
it was nothing but a prospect, but which had then possessed
every indication of being a wonderful producer
of very rich ore, and it was supposed that with a little
further development it would make a very fine property.
The company had immediately proceeded to develop the
mine, following the vein, as they supposed, for several
hundred feet, but it did not amount to anything worth
speaking of. Occasionally they would find croppings of
very rich ore, but no true vein, and they had finally determined
to call in one or two experts, and after an examination,
decide whether it was worth the expenditure
of any more money, or whether it had better be abandoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, aside from having received a fine education
in this branch of science, I had worked a good deal in
some of old Nature&rsquo;s laboratories, and was more familiar
with these things than they thought. I knew, from
their talk, that they were not following the course of the
vein, though they thought they were, but of course, I
said nothing of that kind; I was playing green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day we went down into the mine, and I
found just what I expected to find; that they were simply
following a false lead, and in reality, going farther
and farther from the vein every move they made. There
was the original vein to start with, and they had struck
a false lead close beside it, and were going down; digging
down lower and lower, while the true vein was
right over their heads, and those miners and that confounded
expert that knew so much more than I did,
didn&rsquo;t any of them know enough just to look up there
and see it. Why, near the point where they had first
started, I could see the ore shining in places over my
head, and there were croppings of it all along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to make a long story short, I advised them to
stick to the mine, and the expert advised them to abandon
it. A little while afterward, I asked them what they
would take for the mine; of course they thought that
an additional proof of my greenness that I should talk
of buying it, but I hung on, not appearing very anxious
about it of course, for then they might suspect something.
You won&rsquo;t believe me, but I bought that mine for five
hundred dollars, cash, and they thought I was the biggest
fool and tenderfoot that ever came out here. I
tell you, I made sure of a good, clear title to that property,
and then I went to work. I followed the old, original
vein, and in less than six weeks I had gold just a
pouring out of that mine. My! but didn&rsquo;t that company
try to get back then! but I wouldn&rsquo;t have anything
to do with them; I told them I was a greenhorn
and a tenderfoot, and they had better let me alone.
Well, sir, I worked that mine eighteen months, and
cleared, over and above all expenses, one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and then I sold it for half a million,
and those other fellows have been kicking themselves
ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hearty laugh at the termination of the
story, and the company adjourned to the porch and the
open space surrounding the house, for the evening.</p>
<p>Taken all in all, there was in that little company sheltered
under the old house that night, a strange combination
of plots and counter plots, secrets and mysteries;
and to Houston himself, as he sat a little apart from the
others, watching the group with thoughtful eyes, it
seemed a curious coincidence, that, on that evening, and
at that place, there should be assembled so many of the
principal actors in the drama which he knew must ere
long be enacted, and he was unable to shake off a vague
presentiment that this was the opening scene. Just what
would that drama be, he wondered, would it be comedy
or tragedy? never, with all his foresight, dreaming the
depth of tragedy so soon to follow, or recognizing as
such, some of the chief actors, even then passing within
his ken.</p>
<p>On one side of the low porch was seated Miss Gladden,
entertaining Mr. Winters and his son, while behind her,
Lyle was standing with unconscious grace, and a far-away,
dreamy look in her eyes. Just across the entrance,
on the other side, were Lindlay, Van Dorn and Rutherford,
the last two engaged in animated conversation regarding
old times, Lindlay occasionally joining with
them, but most of the time watching Miss Gladden, with
much admiration expressed in his usually critical face.
Mr. Rivers sauntered back and forth before the house,
smoking, while, at a little distance, Mr. Blaisdell, Haight
and Morgan were talking together. Jim Maverick, coming
from behind the house, touched his hat as a salute
to Mr. Blaisdell, and after a quick glance of suspicious
distrust at the elder Mr. Winters, shuffled off in the
direction of the miners&rsquo; quarters. A little later, a man
with powerful, athletic frame, who walked with quick,
elastic step, and yet as though conscious of his power,
passed the house, followed by a fine collie. His hat was
drawn low over his eyes, partly concealing his face, but
this did not prevent his watching the group on the porch
with close, keen scrutiny. Houston and Rutherford
started slightly, and exchanged glances, for they had
recognized their fellow passenger from Valley City, and
they would doubtless have made some comment, but
that just then Miss Gladden spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, dear, I wonder who that can be; he is dressed
like a miner, but his carriage and appearance is that of
a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered Lyle, in a low tone, &ldquo;is Jack; he is
a miner, and he is also a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Several days had elapsed since the eastern party, accompanied
by Mr. Blaisdell and Mr. Rivers, had returned
to the city, and, as yet, nothing had been learned
of their decision regarding the mine. The extra force
of men on the Sunrise had returned to their regular
shifts, and the work at the mining camp was going forward
in the old routine, with the monotonous precision
of clock-work.</p>
<p>Houston was quietly pursuing his own way, conscious
that the task before him involved difficulty and danger.
He was aware that Haight, notwithstanding his obsequious
politeness, was one of his worst enemies, and
would injure him in every underhanded way within his
power, as, beneath the smooth, smiling exterior, Houston
could detect a deep, subtle malignity toward himself;
and he rightly judged that Jim Maverick, the tool
of the mining company, would be the instrument Haight
would use when he was ready to work his revenge.</p>
<p>Maverick, from the first, had hated Houston with that
instinctive hatred which such vile natures, groveling in
their own degradation, always feel toward those moving
on a higher plane, in an atmosphere untainted by
the putrescence which is their natural element. Maverick
knew that, to a man like Houston, his own baseness
and villainy were written in his face, and even in
his slouching, cringing gait, as plainly as though branded
in letters of fire, and this was sufficient to kindle his anger
against him, and Haight, by his talk, added fuel to the
slowly smoldering fire. At home, but more particularly
among the miners, in the camp or at the Y, Maverick
expressed his views regarding Houston in language
abounding with profanity and obscenity, and many were
the muttered threats of what he would do should the object
of his hatred ever cross his path.</p>
<p>Houston, meanwhile, was quick to discern the danger
signals, and was laying his plans wisely and well. His
own work in the office of the mining camp was nearly
completed; there remained yet the information to be
gathered from the Silver City office, to which he was now
expecting to be called any day, and then the work of
familiarizing himself with the mines. When this should
be accomplished, the end, for which he was working and
waiting, would be very near.</p>
<p>As he sat in the office one afternoon, reviewing the
past few weeks, he felt that he had succeeded thus far,
even beyond his hopes. The coming of Van Dorn and
the acquaintance formed with Lindlay would be of untold
value to him in his work. A little later, Van Dorn
would come to his assistance without arousing suspicion,
not being known as a mining expert, and when the time
came for the final denouement, Lindlay would accompany
Mr. Cameron to the mines, as he was a skilled expert,
and having already visited the mines, could furnish
testimony as to the fraud practiced by the company.</p>
<p>Thus far, everything had gone well, and the weeks of
work in a secluded mining camp, to which he had looked
forward with anything but pleasurable anticipations,
had in reality proven,&ndash;&ndash;he was surprised to admit to himself,&ndash;&ndash;among
the pleasantest of his life. He would really
have many regrets on leaving the mountains to return
to his old home, he had formed such pleasant associations;
and then, he suddenly became conscious that,
of his life among the mountains, there was little he would
miss, excepting a pair of dark, soulful eyes, in whose
depths he had failed to detect the least shadow of falseness
or unworthiness; mirrors of a sweet, womanly
nature, strong, pure and beautiful, which with a quick,
ready sympathy entered into his feelings, and often
seemed to fathom his unspoken thoughts, and clothe
them with language of her own.</p>
<p>Houston started in astonishment, and, locking the office,
took a circuitous and little traveled road, determined
to fully understand his own heart before he again looked
into those eyes with their depths of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p>For many years he had been the recipient of flattering
attentions from fond papas and aspiring mammas.
Invitations to club dinners, banquets and the most recherche
lunches, on the one hand, were evenly balanced
by cards to receptions, soirees and afternoon teas, on the
other. Had he passed heart-whole through all these
sieges, only to fall a victim, here and now?</p>
<p>He had admired Miss Gladden from the first; then,
in their mutual sympathy for Lyle, they had been drawn
closer together, and since that time,&ndash;&ndash;yes, he could see
it all now.</p>
<p>Of Miss Gladden herself he knew very little, except
that she was a true, noble woman; he needed no words to
tell him that. Rutherford had learned from conversation
with her, that she was an orphan, and had been
traveling with friends because her home was made unpleasant
by some of her relatives; and both had judged
that she was probably, in a measure, dependent upon
wealthy relatives.</p>
<p>This much Houston did know, however, that he loved
Leslie Gladden, that she was worthy of his love, and that
life without her would not seem worth the living. He
believed that she loved him, and his heart thrilled with
the thought, that if so, it was for himself, not his wealth,
that she cared. Before he reached the house, his mind
was fully decided:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her for herself,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;not caring
whether she is rich or poor, and I believe she does, or
will, love me in like manner. In any event, I must learn
my fate before the arrival of my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Houston approached the house, Miss Gladden and
Lyle were standing together in the porch. He greeted
both ladies with even more than his usual courtesy, but
as his eyes met those of Miss Gladden, there was that in
his glance, which in itself, was a declaration of his love
for her. Lyle, with her quick intuition, read the meaning,
and with her natural sense of delicacy, as quickly
withdrew, leaving them together. For an instant, Miss
Gladden&rsquo;s eyes dropped before Houston&rsquo;s glance, while
a lovely color suffused her cheek; then she raised her
eyes, meeting his with an answering glance, and in that
mutual recognition, though no word was spoken, they
knew that they were lovers, and that was enough for the
present.</p>
<p>Of late, the four friends had spent much time together;
sometimes climbing the mountains, to watch from their
lofty summits the setting sun, slowly descending amid
clouds of flame, whose glowing colors were reflected
from the surrounding peaks in ever varying tints; the
rose changing to amethyst and violet, and the violet
deepening to purple; while far below, the canyon lay
wrapped in soft, gray twilight. Or, sometimes, taking
one or two boats from the little boat-house built for the
accommodation of summer tourists, they rowed about
the lake in the moonlight.</p>
<p>On this particular night, Rutherford proposed a row,
in one of the larger boats, the entire length of the lake,
to the cascades, to which the rest readily acceded. The
ladies soon appeared in light, fleecy wraps, Miss Gladden
carrying a fine guitar, which called forth exclamations
of pleasure from the gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;that will be just the thing;
now we will have some music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gladden,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;why have we not
been favored in this way earlier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she replied, archly, &ldquo;it has never been a necessity
until to-night, but a long row in the moonlight would
not be perfect without music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was their first trip to the end of the lakes, and
they found the scene beautiful beyond description. On
one side an almost perpendicular wall of rock; in the
opposite direction, the mountain ranges stretching far
away in the distance, with snowy peaks gleaming here
and there, like watch towers; while just before them,
the shimmering cascades in the wondrous beauty of the
moonlight, the deep, unceasing roar seeming to rise and
fall with a rhythm of its own.</p>
<p>For the first few moments, they sat in silent admiration
of the beauty around them; then Miss Gladden
touched the strings of the guitar, and began singing in
a rich contralto, in which Houston joined with a fine
baritone, while Rutherford added a clear, sweet tenor.
Their voices blended perfectly, and accompanied by the
sweet notes of the guitar, the music floated out over the
lake, the lingering echoes dying away, in the distance.</p>
<p>Lyle took no part in the song, but sat listening with
parted lips and dreamy eyes. When the song was finished,
she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please do not stop, I love to listen to you; it reminds
me of something I have heard long ago, I don&rsquo;t
know when or where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you never sing, Miss Maverick?&rdquo; asked Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sometimes for myself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know only
two or three songs that I have heard others sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have a sweet voice,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;will
you not sing for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will overlook any mistakes, I may,&rdquo; answered
Lyle, &ldquo;for I probably do not sing correctly, as I know
nothing of music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Lyle, we would like to hear you,&rdquo; said Miss
Gladden.</p>
<p>As simply, and as free from self-consciousness as a
child, Lyle began her song, her eyes fixed on the distant
shining peaks, and her only accompaniment the music
of the cascades.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Love is come with a song and a smile,<br />

<span class='indent1'>&nbsp;</span>Love will stay for a whole life long.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Whether Lyle sang correctly that night was never
known; even the beautiful words of the old song that
seemed so appropriate to the occasion, were forgotten
before she had sung more than two or three lines, and
her listeners sat entranced, spell-bound, by the voice of
the singer; a voice of such exquisite sweetness and clearness,
and yet possessing such power and depth of expression,
that it thrilled the hearts of her listeners, seeming
to lift them out of all consciousness of their surroundings,
and to transport them to another world; a world</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Where the singers, whose names are deathless,<br />
One with another make music, unheard of men.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>As the last note died away, a long, deep sigh from
Houston seemed to break the spell, and Miss Gladden
looking up, her eyes shining with unshed tears, said, as
she pressed Lyle&rsquo;s hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, we have found our song-queen, our nightingale.
We can all learn of you, and never equal you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston had been strangely moved, and as he spoke,
there was a slight tremor in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard, in all my life, but one voice like that,
and that was one who died when I was a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has no one ever told you you could sing?&rdquo; asked
Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never sang for any one, excepting once, for Jack,&rdquo;
answered Lyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say of your voice?&rdquo; inquired Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, like Mr. Houston, that he had heard but one
voice like mine, but that he did not like to hear me, so
I have never sung since, excepting by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden suddenly, &ldquo;how old is this
man whom you call Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly forty, perhaps a little less,&rdquo; she answered indifferently.</p>
<p>A new thought had flashed into Miss Gladden&rsquo;s mind.
For some time she had doubted whether Lyle were really
a child of Maverick and his wife, she was so utterly unlike
them; could it be possible that Jack, whose life
seemed so much a mystery, was the father of Lyle? Was
that the reason for his interest in her? and had Lyle had
some beautiful mother,&ndash;&ndash;unfortunate perhaps,&ndash;&ndash;whose
life had suddenly gone out, as the little life had just begun,
and whose memory was recalled too vividly by
Lyle&rsquo;s song? Miss Gladden determined, if possible, to
find a clue to this mystery.</p>
<p>The boat was now on its homeward way, and a song
with which all were familiar having been found, the four
voices blended in exquisite harmony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me there are some rare treats in store for
us,&rdquo; was Rutherford&rsquo;s comment, as the friends separated
for the night; then, a few moments later, when
alone with Houston, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Houston! but what a voice that girl has!
I never heard anything like it in my life. I didn&rsquo;t say
much before Miss Gladden, for fear she might think I
didn&rsquo;t appreciate her singing, and I certainly did, for she
sings magnificently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no fear of any sensitiveness on Miss
Gladden&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; said Houston quickly, &ldquo;in the first place,
their voices are altogether different, there is no comparison
between them; and in addition, Miss Gladden&rsquo;s
regard for Lyle is so disinterested and unselfish, there
would be no room for any feeling of that kind. We must
all acknowledge that Lyle certainly has a wonderful
voice; as I said before, I have heard but one like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; said Rutherford, with more feeling
than Houston had ever seen him manifest, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
for that girl, Houston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Houston quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, only to think of her beauty and intellect, and
such a voice as that, and then think of her parents, and
the life to which she is tied down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granting the parents and present life,&rdquo; said Houston,
&ldquo;is that any argument that she will always be &lsquo;tied down
here&rsquo; as you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would always fetter her in a measure; it
will leave its imprint upon her mind, or at least her memory,
and although she is not in her proper sphere here,
yet her life here, and all its associations, would be likely
to make her feel out of place in a higher sphere,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Houston, watching Rutherford
closely, &ldquo;I think if she could be removed from here, and
given a thorough education, there would remain no trace
whatever of the early life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the question of heredity?&rdquo; asked
Rutherford, &ldquo;there must be bad blood there, when and
where would it make its appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a serious question,&rdquo; replied Houston,
&ldquo;providing she is the child of these people; I have
always had grave doubts of that, and Miss Gladden has
often expressed the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I never thought of that! It seems likely
enough, too. What do you think, that she was stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Houston slowly, &ldquo;that does not seem so
probable as that she may have been some child that they
were hired to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;I should think the
uncertainty regarding her family and origin, would be
almost as bad as the certainty in the other case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might seem so to some people,&rdquo; Houston replied,
adding with a smile, &ldquo;especially to a Bostonian, who
prided himself upon his &lsquo;blue blood&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Rutherford, coloring, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not pursuing
this inquiry on my own account at all, I was only thinking
of her prospects generally. I&rsquo;m not interested
in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what direction are you interested, if I may ask?&rdquo;
said Houston, experiencing, for the first time, a little
twinge of jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the direction of the &lsquo;Hub,&rsquo; my dear boy,&rdquo; Rutherford
replied, with another blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true Bostonian!&rdquo; said Houston approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; continued Rutherford, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little girl
belongs back there in Boston, that&rsquo;s more to me than all
the ladies you can produce in this part of the country,
or any other, no matter how beautiful they may be; and
she&rsquo;s not bad looking either. Her parents took her to
Europe for a little trip this spring, and Boston seemed
so lonesome, that was the reason I came west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Ned, you have my best wishes,&rdquo; said
Houston, shaking hands with his friend, &ldquo;but really, you
and Lyle had seemed so fond of each other&rsquo;s society lately,
that I thought perhaps it was to be your destiny to
rescue her from her unhappy fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to each other&rsquo;s society,&rdquo; said Rutherford,
very slowly, &ldquo;of late we have been restricted to that or
none, for you and Miss Gladden have been growing so
unconscious of us, that we&rsquo;ve had to console with each
other; but then, I understood how &rsquo;twas, for I&rsquo;ve been
there myself, you know, and I&rsquo;m ready to offer congratulations
and all that sort of thing, whenever they are in
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston appeared very unconscious of Rutherford&rsquo;s
meaning, as he inquired, &ldquo;How does Lyle herself regard
your attentions? There must be no trifling with her, I
have too much regard for her myself, for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Maverick is not a girl to be trifled with,&rdquo; replied
Rutherford, &ldquo;I think a good deal of her, since I am
better acquainted with her, and respect her and she
knows it, but I think she realizes the sort of anomalous
position that she occupies, and that is why I say I am
sorry for her. She is far too brilliant for her surroundings,
and yet not fitted for a much higher place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at present,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;but with her natural
endowments and her innate delicacy and refinement,
comparatively little training and culture would be necessary
to fit her for almost any position in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what will be her fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will tell,&rdquo; replied Houston, who had his own
plans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>Houston had been called away to the office at Silver
City, a telegram coming one afternoon for him to come
down by the next train. Rutherford was at that time
expecting to leave in a few days, to continue his pleasure
trip to the coast, having already prolonged his stay
among the mountains far beyond his first intentions;
but at Houston&rsquo;s request, he agreed to remain over until
the latter&rsquo;s return, which he expected would be in
about ten days.</p>
<p>A few days after Houston&rsquo;s departure, Lyle started out
one afternoon for the little cabin, at an hour a little later
than she went to pursue her studies, or for reading. She
knew that at this time, Jack usually came off his shift,
as he and Mike were expert miners, and always completed
their task some time in advance of the others.</p>
<p>She had not seen Jack since the visit of the party from
the east, although she was at the cabin but a few evenings
preceding that event, and had explained her long
absence. Now she had special reasons for wishing to
meet him, and she hastened on, hoping to find him alone.
When she reached the cabin, Jack had just come from
the mine, and Mike, fortunately, had gone down to the
Y for needed supplies, and would not return for some
hours.</p>
<p>After talking a little while, Lyle skillfully brought the
conversation around to Mr. Houston, and stated that he
was in Silver City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he doing there?&rdquo; asked Jack, in a tone of surprise,
&ldquo;Is he going to remain there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he has gone over temporarily to assist the company
in that office, as he said they needed extra help;
he thought he would be back in about ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to make a very efficient clerk for the mining
company,&rdquo; said Jack, with a peculiar emphasis which
Lyle did not understand, but in which she detected a
flavor of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems efficient in whatever he undertakes,&rdquo; she
replied with a light laugh, &ldquo;clerking, fighting or love-making,
he is successful in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How has he succeeded in love-making?&rdquo; asked Jack
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Miss Gladden,&rdquo; was Lyle&rsquo;s smiling rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he really in love with her, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by indications, it is a case of genuine love
on both sides, which, contrary to the old proverb, does
run smoothly so far. I think they are engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are left out in the cold?&rdquo; asked Jack kindly,
but watching her keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not think so, if you could know how kind
they are to me,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;you and they are the
only friends I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Mr. Rutherford? Isn&rsquo;t he a friend of
yours, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rutherford is a gentleman,&rdquo; she replied slowly,
&ldquo;he always treats me with respect, and we have very
pleasant times together, but he never forgets that I belong
to one station in life, and he to another. He
is altogether unlike Mr. Houston and Miss Gladden; I
wish you could know them, Jack, and that they could
know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They probably have no desire to form my acquaintance,
and I have no need to form theirs. It is rather late
in the day for me to make friends now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jack,&rdquo; said Lyle, in almost a pleading tone, &ldquo;Miss
Gladden wishes to meet you, and has repeatedly asked
me to inquire if she might come and see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is her motive for wishing to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think because I have often spoken of you as my
friend; then she said recently, that she would like, if
possible, to take me east with her, and give me a musical
education, and she would like to talk with you about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she or Mr. Houston heard you sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say of your voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gladden seems to think I have a wonderful
voice, and Mr. Houston said he had heard but one like
it in all his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had risen, and was looking out of the window,
his back toward Lyle; after a few moments he spoke, in
an unusually gentle tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say to Miss Gladden, that if she wishes to see
me regarding you, she is welcome to come. Though I
seldom receive callers, and have no wish to meet strangers,
I am willing to meet a true friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, under those conditions,&rdquo; said Lyle, with almost
a tone of triumph in her voice, &ldquo;you would meet Mr.
Houston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Jack, quickly, turning toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head, and began pacing the room.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, as gently as ever, but very firmly, &ldquo;I
would rather not meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle looked troubled. &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;you
have always appeared rather peculiar regarding Mr.
Houston; tell me candidly, are you his friend, or his
enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise, stopping before her,
and looking into her earnest face, with a smile, &ldquo;How
should I be either? Am I not perfectly neutral? Are
we not strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle shook her head decidedly. &ldquo;I cannot say whether
or not you are strangers, but you are not neutral toward
him; I have seen all along that you have some strong
feeling toward him, but whether of kindness or enmity,
I cannot tell, but I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must you know?&rdquo; he asked, resuming his walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can tell you later,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but, as
you are my friend, I must know whether you are, or will
be, his friend, or his enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments Jack was silent, and when he spoke
his voice was full of some strong emotion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I have no reason for any enmity
toward him, and if he is the true, honorable man that you
think he is, God knows I would stand by him, even to
death itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if he was in difficulty or danger, and needed
help, you would help him, would you not?&rdquo; asked Lyle
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he answered gravely, &ldquo;you must explain
yourself; you certainly can trust me. I promise you
this, I will not harm him or betray him, whatever may
be the difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure there is no one to hear us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make sure,&rdquo; he answered briefly, and bidding
the collie guard the outside door, he then closed the
door between the two rooms, and sat down near Lyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;the evening you passed
our house?&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;Well, among the strangers
there that night, were an English expert, Mr. Lindlay,
and a Mr. Van Dorn, who, they said, was an inventor of
some mining machinery. A little while after you passed,
I took a book and went out by the lake to read, sitting
down behind a thick group of small evergreens. I read
as long as I could see, and then sat for some time, thinking,
and watching the reflection of the moon in the lake.
Then the moon went behind that tall peak, you know,
across the lake, and it was quite dark; but I remained
there thinking so deeply that, although for a few minutes
I heard low voices talking, I paid no attention to it, supposing
it was simply some people going up the mountain,
till suddenly I was aroused by Mr. Houston&rsquo;s voice,
only a few feet from me, saying in a low tone, &lsquo;There
may be considerable danger ahead of us, but you are
just the one I need, and you will be well compensated,&rsquo;
and Mr. Van Dorn answered, &lsquo;Hang compensation! if
I can help you get the best of these rascals, I&rsquo;m going
to do it, just for the gratification of the thing,&rsquo; and then
I heard the Englishman, with his peculiar accent, saying
something I couldn&rsquo;t quite catch, but it seemed to
be to the effect that he would help Mr. Houston against
what he called the &lsquo;domned scoundrels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, I wanted to leave, but I couldn&rsquo;t without
their seeing me, and having to make explanations, and
making it embarrassing all round; and then the thought
flashed through my mind that Mr. Houston was a good
friend of mine, and perhaps if I stayed, I might be able
to help him if he should be in any danger later, as he
spoke of, so I remained there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to tell you all I heard, but this is what
I learned: He is not a clerk at all, but is out here in the
interest of some rich company in the east, with which an
uncle of his is connected. This eastern company have
for some time suspected crooked work on the part of
the company here, and he has come out in the capacity
of bookkeeper and clerk to get all the information he
can against them. He has obtained all the proofs he can
get in this office, and said he was going over in a few
days to the main office at Silver City,&ndash;&ndash;and that is where
he is now,&ndash;&ndash;to see what he can find against them there.
When he returns he is going to examine the mines that
this eastern company own, as fast as he can get opportunities,
and it seems this Mr. Van Dorn is a mining expert
himself, though no one out here knows it, and when
Mr. Houston is ready, he is to come out here with some
of his mining machinery that he is going to set up in the
mills, to show the company his new method of reducing
ores, but his real object in coming will be to help Mr.
Houston carry on his investigations against the company.
Then, when they have obtained all the information and
proof they need, they will telegraph Mr. Houston&rsquo;s uncle,&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Cameron, I think was his name,&ndash;&ndash;and he and
the English expert will come out together, unexpectedly
to the company, and I think they said they would
prosecute the officers of the company for fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face was concealed with one hand, but Lyle
could see that he had grown very pale, and beneath the
heavy, black beard, his lips were moving under the influence
of some deep emotion. She continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My reason for wishing to confide this to you was,
that I heard Mr. Van Dorn ask Mr. Houston if there
was any one among the miners whom he could trust to
help them, as he said without the assistance of some one,
familiar with the mines and their different workings, the
undertaking would be much more difficult and dangerous;
and I thought at once of you, Jack. You have
often told me of the dishonesty and fraud practiced by
the company, and said that you would like to see some
of their schemes exposed, and I thought you would be
just the one to help Mr. Houston, and no one would be
likely to suspect you either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a moment, then added, &ldquo;He has enemies
working against him, and he ought to have some one to
help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are his enemies?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haight, for one, and my father and all the men that
he can influence; and you know, that if they once suspected
what he is doing, they would not hesitate, for one
moment, to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would not,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly but decidedly,
&ldquo;and among the mines it is a very easy thing to put a
man out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will look out for him, and help him, will
you not?&rdquo; said Lyle, rising to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child,&rdquo; he answered with unusual tenderness,
&ldquo;you do not know what you are asking, but since hearing
what you have told me, no harm shall come to your
friend that I can prevent, no matter what it costs me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jack,&rdquo; said Lyle anxiously, going to him and
laying her hands in his, &ldquo;this will not put you in danger,
will it? My idea was that you could give him information,
and no one would ever suspect you; but you have
been too true a friend to me, for me to put you in any
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need have no fear,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I did not refer
to any particular danger of that kind. I am only
glad you have told me what you have. Had I learned
it in any other way, I would have wished to help your
friend. When he returns, say nothing to him of having
asked me to help him; I will find him in my own way.&rdquo;
 Lyle thanked Jack heartily, and as she looked up into
his face, her beautiful eyes unusually bright, and her
cheeks flushed with emotion, he seemed strangely
touched, and bending over her, kissed her reverently on
her forehead, for the first time in their acquaintance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>
<p>Nearly a week after the departure of Houston for Silver
City, as Morgan was passing the sorting rooms one
morning, on his way from the mines to the mills, he
heard Haight calling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there, Morgan, the Sunrise deal is off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off? who says so? Got a wire from the boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she just came, about fifteen minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? did the old man say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very definite; &lsquo;party writes property not satisfactory,&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s all he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it! I should think it looked good enough for
&rsquo;em. Well,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s so much hard work
gone for nothing,&rdquo; and thrusting his hands deeper into
his pockets in his disgust, Morgan started on his way,
but Haight detained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute; say, Morgan, you don&rsquo;t suppose
that they caught on to our deal, do you? or that anybody
put &rsquo;em onto it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was there to put &rsquo;em onto anything?&rdquo; asked
Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the confidential clerk, may be; he was on such
good terms with Johnny Bull and the dude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan shook his head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too much of a sucker
for the company, and knows too well which side his
bread is buttered, for business of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Haight, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a dude
and a tenderfoot himself, and likes to toady around with
those eastern snobs; what else were they hob-nobbing
with him for, if they didn&rsquo;t think they could get some information
out of him? I&rsquo;ve got my own ideas on that
subject and I&rsquo;m going to make some investigations, and
if I find I&rsquo;m correct, he&rsquo;ll find pretty quick where he will
be; I&rsquo;ve no use for him any way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any more use for him than you have,&rdquo; answered
Morgan, &ldquo;but he ain&rsquo;t a very safe fellow to fool
with now, I can tell you, and I don&rsquo;t think you want to
run up against him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;ve said anything about running
up against anybody,&rdquo; said Haight, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t my style,
but I&rsquo;ll run him out of this country in one way or another,
see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re pretty smooth,&rdquo; Morgan called
over his shoulder, as he started for the mills, &ldquo;and if you
want to undertake the job, all right; for my part, I don&rsquo;t
care to have much to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three evenings later, as Lyle sat in her favorite
nook beside the lake, book in hand, watching for the
return of Miss Gladden who had gone with Rutherford
for a short row, she was much surprised to see Haight
approaching, wearing his most ingratiating smile. For
a day or two, he had, on several occasions, when unobserved
by the others, treated her with a marked politeness
intended to be very flattering, for the thought had
occurred to him that possibly through her he might get
some information regarding Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said now, seating himself at a little distance
from her, and with a glance at the book which she had
closed and laid aside, &ldquo;I fear I have interrupted your
reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not reading,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I was merely glancing
over a book of Miss Gladden&rsquo;s while awaiting her
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments he talked in a light, frivolous manner,
but Lyle, suspicious of some ulterior motive in his
coming, did not respond very favorably to his efforts at
conversation. At last he said, very pleasantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a favorite resort of yours, is it not, Miss Maverick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I come here frequently,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judged so,&rdquo; he continued carelessly, &ldquo;I saw you
out here the evening the eastern party was at the house,
and I remember the English expert and his friend took
a walk in this direction, with Mr. Houston. I suppose
they were talking over the mine they had looked at, and
took Mr. Houston along thinking he might be able to
give them any additional information they needed. I
wonder what they thought about that mine,&rdquo; he added,
watching Lyle, &ldquo;I suppose you must have overheard
some of their conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle was not taken off guard, however, and answered
indifferently, &ldquo;I heard voices, but I was so absorbed in
thought I paid little attention to them; it was some time
before I even recognized them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you certainly must have overheard some of their
conversation,&rdquo; said Haight, in his smoothest tones, &ldquo;can
you not recall anything said about the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing whatever said about the mine,&rdquo;
she replied, &ldquo;and if there had been, I am not in the habit
of listening to conversations and repeating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, under ordinary circumstances,&rdquo;
Haight rejoined, smiling, &ldquo;but you know &lsquo;all is fair in
love and war&rsquo; and in mining deals, and as I am interested
in behalf of the company, and we have, as yet, heard
nothing from the party, you see I naturally had a little
curiosity regarding their conversation that evening.
You are sure they said nothing of the mine, or that Mr.
Houston gave them no information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle rose, her eyes flashing with scorn and indignation,
as she replied, &ldquo;Why should Mr. Houston give
them any information? As I have told you, there was
nothing said about the mine; so far as I could judge,
the gentlemen were talking of their own personal affairs;
and it is false that you have received no word from
the eastern party, for I heard you and Morgan talking
at the table yesterday of the deal having fallen through,
and you suspect Mr. Houston of dishonorable conduct
only because you judge every one to be like yourself,&rdquo;
and without giving him opportunity to reply, she turned
and walked in the opposite direction toward the boat
which she saw approaching in the distance.</p>
<p>Haight walked away toward the house, conscious that
his interview had been a failure, but more than ever determined
to work his revenge upon Houston, and upon
Lyle also, when the right time came.</p>
<p>Lyle determined, for the present, to say nothing regarding
the interview, and met her friends without any
allusion to what had just occurred.</p>
<p>After assisting Miss Gladden ashore, Rutherford returned
to the boat, while Miss Gladden and Lyle started
homeward. The former could detect in Lyle&rsquo;s manner
signs of unusual excitement, but asked no questions, as
she did not think it best to force her confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, when are you going to take me to call on your
friend, Jack?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you wish,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;I spoke to him
the other day about your coming, and he said you would
be most welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he graciously consented to receive me! Very
well, suppose we go now, it is not late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at the cabin, they found Jack and Mike sitting
outside the door, watching the last fleeting colors of
the gorgeous sunset. Miss Gladden was duly introduced,
and invited within, and since the bashful Irishman could
not be prevailed upon to enter the cabin, Jack entertained
his guests alone.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden, from Lyle&rsquo;s description of her friend,
had expected to find in Jack a gentleman, but she was
totally unprepared for the polished courtesy, the courtly
ease and grace without a trace of self-consciousness or
restraint, with which, though clad in rough, miner&rsquo;s
clothes, he received her in the little cabin, and as she
conversed with him, she found her respect for him increasing
every moment.</p>
<p>To Jack, isolated as he had been for years from refined,
intellectual associations, it seemed like a glimpse into
another, and not unfamiliar world, and the deference
and respect expressed in Miss Gladden&rsquo;s manner were
especially gratifying.</p>
<p>Very easily Miss Gladden led the conversation, avoiding,
with intuitive delicacy, all allusions to himself or
his surroundings, till at last she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken such an interest in my friend, Lyle, and
she has so often spoken of your kindness to her, that I
have wished to meet you, for I feel that in her welfare, we
have a mutual interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack smiled gravely, as he replied, &ldquo;I have endeavored
to help her as best I could under existing conditions,
and notwithstanding the fact that the ways and means
have been exceedingly restricted, she has proven herself
an apt pupil, and has made good progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed she has,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;and with her
ability, it seems a pity that she should not have every
possible advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it seems a great pity that so
much of her life has already been spent among such disadvantages,
the greater part of the most valuable portion
of her life wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely wasted,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;for what
you have taught her will be of inestimable value to her
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Lyle, &ldquo;what would my life
have been without you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have laid the foundation so far as I was able,&rdquo; said
Jack, smiling, &ldquo;but it was time, long ago, for the superstructure
to be builded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One reason why I wish to see you,&rdquo; continued Miss
Gladden, &ldquo;was to ask you what you would think of the
feasibility of my taking Lyle east with me, when I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are willing to do that, Miss Gladden,&rdquo; said
Jack, slowly, &ldquo;I can see nothing in the way of its practicability
except to gain the consent of Mr. and Mrs.
Maverick, and that might prove a formidable obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not call them her parents,&rdquo; thought Miss
Gladden, &ldquo;does he know she is not their child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack continued. &ldquo;If it had not been for that difficulty,
I would gladly myself have furnished the means for
a moderate education for Lyle, but I knew Maverick&rsquo;s
decided objection to her possessing even the most rudimentary
knowledge. I am of the opinion also, though I
may be in error, that he would not allow her to leave
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Jack,&rdquo; said Lyle, &ldquo;if I were to wait for
his consent, I would never leave here, or have any advantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire,&rdquo; said Jack, addressing Miss Gladden,
&ldquo;at what time you expect to return east?&rdquo;
A faint color tinged Miss Gladden&rsquo;s cheek, as she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet decided just when I will go east, but
probably the latter part of the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he answered, with a slight smile, &ldquo;I hope
that between now and that time, some arrangement can
be made to Lyle&rsquo;s advantage; but if I may make any
suggestion, it would be this; that nothing be said at
present regarding this subject to either Mr. or Mrs.
Maverick, as it would only arouse their opposition, and
perhaps lead to some unpleasant results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments&rsquo; further conversation, Miss Gladden
thanked Jack for his kindness, and rose to go. At
the door they found Mike, and while Lyle chatted merrily
with the witty Irishman for a moment, Miss Gladden
turned toward Jack, saying in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to have a talk with you regarding Lyle,
some time when she is not present; may I come and see
you by myself some day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;I would be pleased to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Miss Gladden stood in silent admiration,
watching this man whose life seemed wrapped in so
much mystery, while he replied to some laughing questions
of Lyle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He was, even now, a splendid specimen of manhood,
although his shoulders were slightly stooped, and silver
threads gleamed here and there in the black hair and
beard, making him look older than his years. He had a
face of remarkable beauty also,&ndash;&ndash;with fine, clear-cut
features,&ndash;&ndash;though browned with exposure, and bearing
the lines that only the fingers of sorrow can trace.
His face did not resemble Houston&rsquo;s in the least, but
something in his manner reminded Miss Gladden of her
lover, and she watched him with a sort of fascination.</p>
<p>As she and Lyle walked homeward together, the latter
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think now of my friend, Miss Gladden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Gladden replied thoughtfully, &ldquo;I think, my
dear, that he is one of earth&rsquo;s heroes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>
<p>The ten days which Houston was to spend at Silver
City had expired, and his work there was completed. He
had followed much the same plan as in the office at the
camp, doing the work of the company by day, and
pursuing his own investigations at night.</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell had at first objected to his working evenings,
telling him the company had no wish to make a
slave of him, but upon Houston&rsquo;s representing that it
was an absolute necessity in order to accomplish the
needed work within a given time, he allowed him to
have his own way. He had been able to get together
much additional proof regarding the fraudulent transactions
of the company, even ascertaining in what direction
much of the revenue due the New York company
had gone.</p>
<p>He was present when the company received the brief
but pointed letter from Mr. Winters, in which he stated
that the property shown them had not been what they
were looking for, and that they had found something
more satisfactory in another direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, in his quick, incisive
way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not surprised!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;Why not? I
confess I&rsquo;m surprised and disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what I expected,&rdquo; again chirped Mr. Rivers,
&ldquo;just what I told you all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you said you were rather suspicious just in
the direction where I felt the surest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, &ldquo;I said all along, &lsquo;those
fish won&rsquo;t bite worth a nickel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;all we
can do is to try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next time, I&rsquo;d advise you to have a little more
bait, or else don&rsquo;t tackle so big a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Houston&rsquo;s last evening in Silver City, and he
sat in the hotel lobby reading letters which had just come
from his uncle and Van Dorn, under cover from the
Chicago firm, as usual.</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron was delighted to have met Van Dorn
and the Englishman, and had engaged both men to remain
in New York, awaiting word from Houston, when
he should be ready.</p>
<p>The closing paragraph in Van Dorn&rsquo;s letter he read
and re-read with a smile, it was so characteristic of his
friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have had one of my machines carefully packed,
and it now stands addressed, ready to accompany me to
your mining camp on short notice, where I will show
your people the latest method for the reduction of ores;
and if the mining company itself is not pretty well reduced&rsquo;
before we get through, my name is not that of</p>
<p class='ralign'>Your friend,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
ARTHUR VAN DORN.<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class='lalign'>P. S. &lsquo;The mills of the gods grind slowly,<br />
<span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>But they grind exceeding small.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Houston folded his letters, his attention was attracted
by loud talk among a group of men in another
part of the lobby. Sauntering in that direction, he heard
an excited voice exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, they&rsquo;re the biggest frauds on the face of
the earth. If there&rsquo;s a dishonest scheme, or a sharp, underhanded
little game that they&rsquo;re not onto, I&rsquo;d like to
know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which company do you mean?&rdquo; inquired another
speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the mining company represented by Rivers
and Blaisdell, with old Wilson as a figure-head. I can&rsquo;t
remember all their long-winded names, but the whole
combination is rotten, from beginning to end, nothing
but a set of lying, scheming, thieving rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said an old gentleman who had not
spoken before, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a tough lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough!&rdquo; echoed the first speaker, &ldquo;I should say so!
One of their little games is to take charge of mining
claims for eastern parties. The parties send on money
for development work, but do you suppose it is used in
developing the mines? Not much! By and by, the first
these parties know, they have forfeited their claims
through lack of representation, but don&rsquo;t you think the
company are not watching out, ready to jump the claim
the very day the time expires. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll hire
some poor Swede to locate the claim for them, and then
assign it to them for a trifle. In that way, I&rsquo;ve heard of
their getting possession of the same claim over and over
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard pretty hard stories about Blaisdell,&rdquo; said
another, &ldquo;but I guess he don&rsquo;t make much for himself,
for as fast as he fleeces other people, Rivers fleeces him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was considerable more talk in the same strain,
but after the group had separated, Houston, who had
learned the name of the principal speaker, approached
him as he was standing alone, and said, in a low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Hartwell, I believe; my name is Houston.
Mr. Hartwell, I heard your remarks a little while
ago concerning the North Western Mining Company
and its officers. I am one of the clerks of that company,
and I wish to know if you are prepared to substantiate
the statements you have made here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man exclaimed with an oath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll substantiate
every word I&rsquo;ve said here to-night, and I can get
you a dozen more that will tell you more about that company
than I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about the others, for the present,&rdquo; replied
Houston coolly, &ldquo;what you have said to-night is likely
to come to the ears of the company, and what I want
to know is this; would you swear in court to what you
have said here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartwell, with another oath,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to it ten times over, and if I ever have a
chance, I&rsquo;ll down you and your cursed company till you
won&rsquo;t know that you ever existed,&rdquo; and then seeming
to take Houston as the representative of the entire
corporation, he poured upon him a torrent of vituperation
and abuse which was very amusing to Houston,
who was only thinking of securing a witness for the
prosecution, by and by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Hartwell,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you seem so
anxious to express your feelings, we may give you an
opportunity later. For the present, I wish you good
evening,&rdquo; and he walked smilingly away.</p>
<p>Mr. Hartwell looked after him in amazement; &ldquo;By
George!&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;but that fellow&rsquo;s a cool duck,
anyhow! I couldn&rsquo;t faze him a particle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, Houston, in company with Mr.
Blaisdell, took the early train for the mines. He could
not help contrasting this with his first trip over the same
road. Then, he was a stranger, with his entire work before
him, uncertain of success in his undertaking; now,
his preparatory work was nearly done, and though the
most difficult part of his task yet remained, he felt that
success was sure. But the contrast which to him seemed,
most striking, was in his own feelings, for though conscious
of enemies and having no knowledge of the
friends ready to assist him, he yet felt a certain pleasure
in returning to the mines, as though returning home;
and he realized as never before, that hidden away in the
heart of the mountains was the source from which henceforth
must flow all his earthly happiness.</p>
<p>Arriving at the office, they found no one there, and
Houston immediately began an attack upon the work
accumulated during his absence, while Mr. Blaisdell proceeded
to the mills and mines.</p>
<p>On his way he met Haight, and the subject of the unsuccessful
mining deal was at once taken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They simply wrote that the property was not what
they wanted, and that they had found what they were
looking for elsewhere,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell in explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seemed well enough satisfied when they were
here,&rdquo; remarked Haight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my impression,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;but
Rivers seems to think differently. He says he was suspicious
of them all the time, because they said nothing
one way or another, after seeing the property; but my
impression was that they were very well pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Haight, who always made it
a practice to have his opinions coincide with those expressed
by the person with whom he happened to be
talking, especially if it were for his interest to do so;
&ldquo;everything seemed satisfactory as far as I could judge.
It is my opinion, Mr. Blaisdell, and has been for some
time, that something must have been said by some one
to prejudice those people against the mine; that is the
only way I could account for the deal falling through as
it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who was there to say anything prejudicial? We
were all interested in selling the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to call any names, Mr. Blaisdell, but I
don&rsquo;t think it best to take people into our confidence till
we are pretty sure of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you allude to Mr. Houston, but you are mistaken
there; why, Haight, that fellow is working for our
interests, and he has saved the company considerable
money already in the way he has straightened the books
and detected crooked work; he&rsquo;s going to be invaluable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll work for our interests just as long as it is for
his interest to do so, but I imagine anybody could buy
him off pretty easy. He&rsquo;s one of your swells; see how
he dresses and what hightoned notions he has for a man
in his position, and then tell me he wouldn&rsquo;t take a little
tip on the outside if he got a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell slowly,
&ldquo;still, of course, there might be something in what you
say; I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; and the subject was dropped for
that day.</p>
<p>Houston was very busy until nearly noon, but left the
office a little earlier than usual, as he was anxious to
meet Miss Gladden a few moments in advance of the
others, if possible.</p>
<p>She was outside the porch, training some vines which
she and Lyle had transplanted from among the rocks by
the lake. Her back was toward the road, but hearing
Houston&rsquo;s step, as he approached the house, she quickly
turned, and in the depths of her luminous eyes he read
a welcome that made his return seem more than ever
like a home-coming. Clasping warmly the shapely little
hand extended to him in greeting, he drew it within
his arm, and having led her to a comfortable seat within
the porch, he drew his own chair close beside her, where
he could watch the lovely face, so classic and perfect in
its beauty, and clothed, when animated, with a subtle,
spirituelle radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very welcome,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, as he
seated himself, &ldquo;we will all have to celebrate your return,
for we have missed you very much. Have you been
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Houston, smiling, &ldquo;except for a
touch of homesickness occasionally when I remembered
our evenings among the mountains, or on the lake. It
was fortunate that my evenings were so crowded with
work, or the malady might have proved quite serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our evenings have not been nearly so pleasant without
you,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;we were all becoming
frightfully dull and vapid, but I think we will now recover
our spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned one thing,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;that it is
not any particular place or surroundings that constitutes
home for us, so much as the presence of those who
are dear to us. Imagine how it would have seemed to
me, three months ago, to have called this place &lsquo;home,&rsquo;
but it seems wonderfully home-like to me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to what constitutes a home, I am scarcely qualified
to judge,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;for I hardly know
what a home is; but my idea is, that any spot where my
best loved ones were, would be home to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with such sentiments as those,&rdquo; Houston responded,
&ldquo;you would make any spot on earth home to
those whom you loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope to,&rdquo; she replied, and added archly,
&ldquo;and if they loved me, I think I would succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said Houston, smiling, &ldquo;that we are very old
fashioned and far behind the spirit of modern times,
which considers love of small account in the elements
that constitute a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it an indispensable element, nevertheless,&rdquo;
she replied, earnestly, &ldquo;for I have seen too much of so-called
homes where it did not exist, and they were not
even successful imitations of the genuine article; their
hollowness and wretchedness were only too apparent.&rdquo;
She paused a moment, then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, the home seems like one of the old-time temples;
a place to be kept sacred to peace and purity and
love; from which the sin and strife of the outside world
should be faithfully excluded; whose inmates, on entering,
should leave behind all traces of the evil and discord
of the outer world, as the Oriental leaves his dust-laden
sandals at the door of his sanctuary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never known any other than such a home
as that,&rdquo; said Houston, slowly, &ldquo;and it is the only true
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;but are your
parents living? I have often wondered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;my parents died when I was a
mere child, but the faint recollection of my early home,
and the memory of my uncle&rsquo;s home, which has been
mine also, correspond very closely with the picture you
have just drawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then with you it is a reality,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but
with me, only an ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gladden,&rdquo; said Houston very earnestly, but
with great tenderness, &ldquo;will you not let me help you to
make a reality of your ideal?&rdquo; Then, as she did not immediately
reply, he continued, &ldquo;The love that we believe
in as the foundation of a true home, is not lacking on
my part. I love you, Leslie, so much that life with you
anywhere would seem perfect and complete, while life
without you, even in a palace, would not seem worth the
living. Can you love me enough to share my life and
home, whatever it may be, as my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had taken her hand, and she did not withdraw it,
but looking in his face, she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you make me your wife, knowing so little of
me as you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know enough,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I know that
you are a pure, true-hearted woman; I know that
whether you love me or not,&rdquo; her eyes dropped, &ldquo;there is
no one you love better than me; and though I do not
know it, I am almost sure that you do care for me in
some degree, am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up into the face bending over her, and
Houston read his answer in her eyes, and even had she
tried to speak, he gave her no opportunity for doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of your conceit!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden,
a few moments later, &ldquo;in having the assurance to say
that I cared for no one more than you, whether I loved
you or not; how did you ever come to make such an assertion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes betrayed you,&rdquo; he answered, while she
blushed, &ldquo;they often tell tales, but I have noticed they
always tell the truth, and I knew they would never have
told me some secrets that they have, if there was any one
else you cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of approaching footsteps interrupted their
conversation, and brought them back to the common,
every-day affairs of life, and turning, they saw Rutherford
coming up the path from the lake, where he had
gone for a stroll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Houston!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter, catching a
glimpse of his friend, &ldquo;when did you come? Well, I&rsquo;m
awfully glad you&rsquo;ve got back, we&rsquo;ve missed you, old fellow,
I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome home!&rdquo; said a sweet voice, and Houston
saw the starry eyes and golden crowned head of Lyle
framed in the door-way, and hastened to greet her. She
met him with a woman&rsquo;s grace, and with a child&rsquo;s affection
looking frankly out of her lovely eyes. After
his brief absence, Houston was impressed by her beauty
as never before. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the child was so beautiful,&rdquo;
he thought to himself, &ldquo;I believe she grows lovelier
every day, and she reminds me strangely of some one I
have seen long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; said Rutherford, as the friends
seated themselves around the dinner table, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just received
a letter from my brother, and he says he is coming
out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden and Houston,
&ldquo;What! coming here among the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;he happened to be in New York
when Van Dorn got back, and from his description of
the place, and mine, he says he would like to see it. He
is coming out to the coast by another route, and wants
me to meet him in San Francisco, and then we will stop
here on our return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are coming back again,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden;
&ldquo;that will be lovely, and we will be delighted to
meet your brother with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we will,&rdquo; added Houston cordially, &ldquo;what
time do you expect to be here, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother wants to get here, he says, in about six
or eight weeks, so it will probably be some time in August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle had said nothing, but had listened to the conversation,
a thoughtful, far-away look stealing into her
eyes; and the rest of the boarders arriving just then,
nothing more was said on the subject.</p>
<p>Haight greeted Houston with his usual smiling politeness,
but Morgan looked sullen, and Mr. Blaisdell was
gloomy and taciturn. Haight&rsquo;s influence was working,
and he could afford to smile. Lyle was quick to note
the situation, and also to detect in Haight&rsquo;s face an expression
of ill-concealed triumph, and as their eyes met,
he read that in her face that boded no good to himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell having returned to the city that same
day, everything went forward in the same regular routine
as prior to Houston&rsquo;s absence, and evening found
the four friends seated on the summit of an immense
rocky pile, watching the grand and rugged scenery surrounding
them illumined by the glowing colors of the
sunset sky. They had been talking of Rutherford&rsquo;s intended
trip to the coast, when Miss Gladden said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston, how early can you join us to-morrow
afternoon? We are going to have a little picnic party
of four, in honor of your return, and also to give Mr.
Rutherford pleasant memories of his last days among
the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;now I understand; I&rsquo;ve wondered
what you ladies were so mysterious about all day;
you&rsquo;ve been holding secret sessions and making cabalistical
signs to each other all the afternoon. Well, as this
picnic is partly on my account, I&rsquo;m sure I feel flattered
and shall be delighted to attend. Houston, old
boy, when can we look for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, considering the importance of the occasion,
I can be ready to join you at three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied
Houston, while the ladies expressed their approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to have been a great deal of mysterious
consultation about this affair,&rdquo; remarked Rutherford,
&ldquo;what is the program for to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;for one thing, we must
have plenty of music; have neither of you gentlemen
any musical instruments with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Houston, while Rutherford answered,
laughing, &ldquo;I have a banjo that I brought along to amuse
myself with in case I got lonesome, but I&rsquo;ve had no use
for it so far, I&rsquo;ve had such good company here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very graceful compliment, thank you,&rdquo; said Miss
Gladden, smiling, &ldquo;but bring the banjo by all means, we
will have use for it to-morrow, and I have just thought
of something else for the occasion,&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m not going
to divulge all my plans, we must keep something for a
surprise, mustn&rsquo;t we, Lyle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle laughed merrily; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell a single
plan of mine; you will all find when we reach the place,
what a mountain picnic means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can we not even know where we are going?&rdquo;
asked Rutherford, with a tragic air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not know if I should tell you,&rdquo; responded
Lyle, &ldquo;we are going to Sunset Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunset Park!&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;where is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in any way connected with the Sunrise mine of
recent fame?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lyle, &ldquo;it is across the lake; you remember
the landing I showed you among the rocks?
You follow the broad trail leading up the mountains,
and you will come to a beautiful plateau on the west side,
as level as a floor,&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m not going to tell you about
it, you must first see it for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, immediately after breakfast, while
Houston still stood talking with Miss Gladden and
Rutherford, the graceful form of Lyle suddenly darted
past them, her face nearly concealed by an enormous
sunbonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, you gypsy, where are you going?&rdquo; called Miss
Gladden.</p>
<p>For answer, she turned and waved her hand with a
merry laugh, then ran, fleet-footed as a deer, to the edge
of the lake, and unfastening one of the little boats, was
in it and rowing out upon the lake as dextrously as a
professional oarsman, before those watching her could
even guess her intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar! but that girl can row!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rutherford, with all the enthusiastic admiration of a
newly graduated collegian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the child going?&rdquo; asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably to the picnic ground,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden,
&ldquo;but what for, I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sunbonnet was waved saucily in the air, and then
instead of steering for the landing place as they expected,
the boat suddenly disappeared around a corner of the
rocks, in the opposite direction, while there came ringing
out on the air, in mocking tones, the words of the
old song:</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;I saw the boat go &rsquo;round the bend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one saw Lyle when she returned, a couple of hours
later, and not even Miss Gladden knew that she was in
the house until she made her appearance at the dinner
table, with a very demure face, exceedingly pink fingers,
and wearing an air of deep mystery that no amount
of joking could diminish.</p>
<p>After dinner, Lyle made two or three trips across the
lake, carrying mysterious baskets and dishes. In one
of these journeys she was intercepted by Miss Gladden,
who was lying in wait for her, and who, tempted by the
delightful aroma, lifted the cover of one of her dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strawberries!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and wild ones!
Where did you get them, Lyle? They are the first I have
seen out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the first that have ripened,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I
went over to the gulch for them this morning, but don&rsquo;t
say anything about them,&rdquo; she added, as she stepped
into the boat with her treasures, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cache
them until they are needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to do what?&rdquo; said Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to &lsquo;cache&rsquo; them, hide them away among the
rocks,&rdquo; she replied laughing, and, taking the oars, she
was soon speeding across the lake.</p>
<p>It was a merry party that started out two or three
hours later. Houston carried the banjo, as Rutherford
had his precious camera and a lot of plates, having declared
his intention of immortalizing the occasion by
taking a number of views for the benefit of their posterity.
Miss Gladden had her guitar, and to the great astonishment
of the gentlemen, Lyle appeared, carrying a fine
old violin. It was Mike&rsquo;s, which she had borrowed for
the occasion at the suggestion of Miss Gladden, and in
reply to the expressions of wonder from the gentlemen,
Miss Gladden said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the surprise I planned for you, but wait till
you have heard her; I never heard her myself until a
day or two ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With song and laughter they crossed the lake, and
having reached the landing place among the rocks and
fastened their boats, proceeded up the mountain. Here
they found a flight of natural stone steps, at the head
of which a broad trail wound around the mountain, until,
having passed a huge, shelving rock, they suddenly
found themselves on a plateau, broad, grassy, and, as
Lyle had said, &ldquo;as level as a floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groups of large evergreens afforded a refreshing
shade. Underneath the trees an immense, flat rock, covered
with a snowy table-cloth and trimmed with vines
and flowers, gave hint of some of the more substantial
pleasures to be looked for later. At a distance gleamed
the silvery cascades, their rainbow-tinted spray rising in
a perpetual cloud of beauty. Far below could be seen
the winding, canyon road, while above and beyond, on
all sides, the mountains reared their glistening crests
against the sky.</p>
<p>For a time they gave themselves up to the enjoyment
of the scene, till, at Miss Gladden&rsquo;s suggestion, the tuning
of the various instruments began, interspersed with
jokes and merry, rippling laughter. Amidst the general
merriment, Houston, with an air of great gravity,
produced from his pocket the different parts of a flute,
which he proceeded to fit together, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were speaking last evening about the
music for to-day I had entirely forgotten the existence
of this flute, but after we went to our room, Ned persisted
in practicing on that unmusical instrument of his,
and in searching in my trunk for a weapon of self defense,
I found this, and it answered my purpose so well
then, I brought it with me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music was a success, and it seemed as though the
musicians would never grow weary, but when, at Miss
Gladden&rsquo;s request, Lyle sang &ldquo;Kathleen Mavourneen,&rdquo;
her sweet, rich tones blending with the wild, plaintive
notes of the violin, her listeners again seemed entranced
by the witchery of the music, as on the night when first
they heard her sing, and were only aroused by the sound
of hearty, prolonged cheering from the canyon below.</p>
<p>Looking over the edge of the plateau, they discovered
a party of about a dozen people, in a wagon drawn
by six horses, who had stopped to listen to the music,
and give their panting animals a chance to rest. Behind
them was a line of three or four pack mules, laden with
tents, cooking utensils and bedding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camping party!&rdquo; exclaimed Lyle, &ldquo;the first of the
season; they are on their way to Strawberry gulch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On catching sight of the group above on the plateau,
the ladies below began waving their handkerchiefs, and
the gentlemen were loud in their cheers and calls for
more music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them another song, Miss Maverick,&rdquo; said
Rutherford, &ldquo;that is a decided encore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more raising her violin, Lyle sang &ldquo;The Maid
of Dundee,&rdquo; and never did song or singer meet with
nobler applause, for the cheers from below in the canyon
were joined with those from above on the plateau,
and were echoed and re-echoed among the rocks, the
last reverberations dying away and mingling with the
roar of the distant cascades.</p>
<p>As the camping party seemed in no haste to continue
their journey, Miss Gladden with the gentlemen
then came forward to the edge of the plateau, and all
joined in singing a few familiar songs, some of them
accompanied by the guitar and the violin, after which,
the party in the canyon, with much waving of hats and
handkerchiefs, and many cheers in token of their appreciation,
passed on their way.</p>
<p>After this little episode, a gypsy fire was kindled, and
in a short time the rock table was spread with a dainty
feast; chicken sandwiches, mountain trout, which Lyle
had caught in the morning, delicately broiled, and the
sweet, wild strawberries served in various ways, all
equally tempting and delicious. After the feast, Houston
proved himself an adept upon the violin, and he and
Rutherford gave a number of college songs, and old
plantation songs and dances, accompanied by the violin
and banjo.</p>
<p>At last, as the long, gray twilight was slowly deepening,
and the stars silently marshaling their forces in the
evening sky, the two boats drifted across the lake, only
guided, not propelled, by the oars, and the air, for a
while, was filled with song. As they slowly approached
the shore, however, the singing gradually ceased. For a
while Rutherford talked of the coming of his brother;
then he and Lyle were silent, but from the other boat, at
a little distance, came low, murmuring tones. They had
just entered upon the first pages of that beautiful story,
old as eternity itself, and as enduring; the only one of
earth&rsquo;s stories upon whose closing page, as we gaze with
eyes dim with the approaching shadows of death, we
find no &ldquo;finis&rdquo; written, for it is to be continued in the
shadowless life beyond.</p>
<p>Rutherford was thinking of some one far away, under
European skies, and wishing that she were present with
him there, to make his happiness complete.</p>
<p>And Lyle, with that face of wondrous beauty, yet
calm and inscrutable as that of the sphinx, had any
power as yet passed over the hidden depths of her
woman&rsquo;s nature, and troubled the waters? Were those
eyes, with their far-away look, gazing into the past with
its strange darkness and mystery, or striving to pierce
the dim, impenetrable veil of the future? No one could
say; perhaps she herself was scarcely conscious, but as
they landed, Miss Gladden noted the new expression
dawning in her eyes, and as the friends and lovers separated
for the night, each one avowing that day to have
been one of the most delightful of their whole lives, she
wound her arm about Lyle in sisterly fashion, and drew
her into her own room. Lyle, as was her custom,
dropped upon a low seat beside her friend, but was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you looking backward or forward, to-night,
Lyle?&rdquo; asked Miss Gladden, taking the lovely face in
both her hands, and gazing into the beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Lyle&rsquo;s color deepened slightly, as she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know; it seems sometimes as if I were looking
into an altogether different life from this, a different
world from that in which I have lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so, my dear?&rdquo; inquired her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know how to describe it myself,&rdquo; she replied;
then asked abruptly, &ldquo;Miss Gladden, do you believe
we have ever had an existence prior to this? that
we have lived on earth before, only amid different surroundings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Miss Gladden, &ldquo;I can see no reason
for such a belief as that; but why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because it seems sometimes as if that were
the only way in which I could account for some of my
strange impressions and feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about them,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so vague,&rdquo; Lyle replied, &ldquo;I hardly know
how to describe them, but I have always felt them, more
or less. When I read of life amid scenes of refinement
and beauty, there is always an indefinable sense of familiarity
about it all; and since you and Mr. Houston
have been here, and I have lived such a different life,&ndash;&ndash;especially
since we have sung together so much,&ndash;&ndash;the
impression is much more vivid than before; even the
music seems familiar, as if I had heard it all, or something
like it, long ago, and yet it is utterly impossible,
living the life I have. It must have been only in my
dreams, those strange dreams I used to have so often,
and which come to me even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are these dreams, dear? You have never
before spoken to me of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;I have never spoken of them
to any one; they have always been rather vague and indefinite,
like the rest of my strange impressions and fancies;
only they are all alike, it is almost precisely the
same dream, no matter when it comes to me. There is
only one feature that is very clear or distinct, and that
is a beautiful face that is always bending over me, and
always seems full of love and tenderness. Sometimes
there are other faces in the background, but they are
confused and indistinct,&ndash;&ndash;I can only recall this one that
is so beautiful. Then there is always a general sense of
light and beauty, and sometimes I seem to hear music;
and then it is all suddenly succeeded by an indescribable
terror, in which the face vanishes, and from which I
awake trembling with fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say you have had this dream always?&rdquo;
queried Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ever since I could remember. I don&rsquo;t seem to
be able to recall much about my early childhood, before
I was five or six years old, but these dreams are among
my earliest recollections, and I would sometimes awake
crying with fright. After I met Jack, and he began
teaching me, my mind was so taken up with study, that
the dreams became less frequent, and for the last two or
three years, I had almost forgotten them, till something
seemed to recall them, and now it occurs often, especially
after we have had an evening of song. I know I
shall see that beautiful face to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whose face is it, Lyle?&rdquo; questioned Miss Gladden;
&ldquo;surely, it must resemble some one you have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle shook her head; &ldquo;I have never seen any living
person whom it resembled. That, together with all
these strange impressions of which I have told you, is
what seems so mysterious, and leads me to half believe
I have lived another life, sometime, somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden sat silently caressing the golden head.
Her suspicions that Lyle had had other parents than
those whom she knew as such, were almost confirmed,
but would it be best, with no tangible proof, to hint such
a thought to Lyle herself? While she was thus musing,
Lyle continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What seemed to me strangest of all, is, that though
I cannot remember ever seeing a living face like the one
in my dream, I have seen what I believe is a photograph
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? and where?&rdquo; asked Miss Gladden quickly,
hoping to find some key to the problem she was trying
to solve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few weeks after your coming, and at Jack&rsquo;s cabin,&rdquo;
Lyle replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jack show you the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not know that he intended me to see it, but
it was lying on the table that evening; I took it up and
looked at it, but he did not seem to want to talk about
it. I have never seen it since, and he told me that until
that evening, he had not seen it for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you recognize it as the face of your
dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not then; it seemed familiar, but it was not until
after I reached home that I remembered my dream, and
from that time, the dream returned. I see the face often
now, and it is just like the picture, only possibly a little
older and sweeter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never spoken to Jack about the picture
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for I have not seen it, and he has never alluded
to it. He admitted that evening it was the picture of
some one he had loved dearly, and I have since thought
perhaps he would rather I had not seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was silent; her old theory regarding
Jack&rsquo;s being the father of Lyle, seemed to her now more
probable than ever. She believed the picture to be that
of Lyle&rsquo;s own mother, who, it seemed evident, had lived
long enough that her child remembered her in her
dreams, though unable to recall her face at other times.</p>
<p>Very tenderly she bade Lyle good-night, determined
that her next call at the little cabin should be made as
early as possible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Houston and Rutherford, on retiring to their room,
after the breaking up of the picnic party, donned their
slippers and smoking jackets, and having lighted their
cigars, and slipped into the easiest possible attitudes,
prepared to devote the next few hours to a confidential
tete-a-tete. The next day Rutherford would start on his
journey to the coast, and naturally there were many topics
of mutual interest to be discussed on this, their last
night together for a number of weeks.</p>
<p>Houston felt that the time had come for taking Rutherford
into his confidence regarding his own work and
plans, for it was evident that Van Dorn had posted his
brother, and Rutherford would soon learn the truth from
him, if in no other way. For a while Rutherford talked
of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he was intending to come west this summer,
and I expected to meet him in some of the cities along
the coast, but I supposed he would return by one of the
southern routes. I&rsquo;m awfully glad he has decided to
come back this way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for I would enjoy it
of course, to come around and see you again, and then,
I&rsquo;d like to have you meet Mort. He and I are not a bit
alike, but I think he&rsquo;s a splendid fellow, and I think you
and he will like each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it, Ned,&rdquo; Houston replied, with
an air of confidence rather surprising to his friend; &ldquo;in
fact, I think I will be as glad to meet him as you yourself;&rdquo;
then, as Rutherford&rsquo;s eyes expressed considerable
wonder at such unexpected cordiality, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking, for some time, Ned, that the
friendship you have shown for the low-salaried clerk
and bookkeeper whom you met on your way out here,
deserves some degree of confidence in return, and this
evening seems to be the best time for giving you a little
explanation regarding the man whom you have called
your friend for the last few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, if you wish,&rdquo; Rutherford replied,
with slight embarrassment, &ldquo;but then, it isn&rsquo;t at all necessary,
you know; that is, unless it is your choice, for your
salary or your position doesn&rsquo;t cut any figure with me.
Whatever your circumstances may be, I know as well
as I need to know that you are a gentleman; anybody
can see that, and I have told my brother so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you, Ned,&rdquo; Houston answered,
with difficulty restraining a smile, &ldquo;but I am going to
begin by saying that your brother knows me a great deal
better than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford&rsquo;s face expressed so much astonishment,
that it resembled nothing so much as an exaggerated
exclamation point. Houston continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never in my life known what it was to have an
own brother, but the one who for many years has held
that place in my heart is Morton Rutherford, and I think
he will tell you that of all his class mates, there was not
one with whom he was upon more intimate, confidential
terms, than Everard Houston, of New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard Houston! Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed Rutherford,
springing to his feet, &ldquo;why I remember that
name well; he was Mort&rsquo;s best friend. You don&rsquo;t mean
to say you are the same? Why, I thought you said you
were from Chicago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was from Chicago, when you met me,&rdquo; answered
Houston, smiling, &ldquo;but I had come from New York less
than ten days before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by Jove!&rdquo; said Rutherford, walking up and
down the room, &ldquo;I am floored completely! If you had
once said you were from New York, I might have suspected
who you were, but Chicago! and then,&rdquo; here he
stopped and gazed at his friend with a comical look of
perplexity, &ldquo;why, Everard Houston was the nephew and
adopted son of W. E. Cameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; assented Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what in thunder,&ndash;&ndash;if I may ask the question,&ndash;&ndash;are
you doing out here with this confounded Buncombe-Boomerang
mining company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I wished to tell you to-night,&rdquo;
Houston replied, &ldquo;but we must talk low, for walls sometimes
have ears,&rdquo; and placing a chair for his friend near
his own, he proceeded to tell him of his object in coming
out to the mining camp, of the work which he had accomplished,
and of his plans for what yet remained to be
done. Rutherford listened with much interest, deepening
into admiration for his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Houston, in conclusion, &ldquo;you will see
why I could not very well reveal my identity to you
when we first met. I knew you as soon as I saw your
card, but I was a stranger in this part of the country,
with a certain role to play, uncertain of success, and, not
knowing what difficulties or obstacles I might meet,
thought there would be less danger of unexpected complications,
if you thought me just what I appeared to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought about right, too,&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;for
I&rsquo;m awfully careless about anything of that kind, always
putting my foot in it, you know; and I don&rsquo;t see how
you ever could come out here, a perfect stranger, and
carry everything along as smoothly as you have. Well,
I remember I was awfully mixed there on the train,
when you told me you had come out here to work for
that company, for I thought all the time that if you were
not a gentleman, then I never saw one; and it&rsquo;s lucky I
did have sense enough to think of that, or I might have
made a confounded chump of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have cut me, would you?&rdquo; asked Houston,
laughing, &ldquo;I was looking out for that, and would
have considered it a rich joke if you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather too rich, I should say,&rdquo; said Rutherford,
coloring. &ldquo;Mort has always ridiculed me for that sort
of thing, and told me I&rsquo;d make a precious fool of myself
some day; I don&rsquo;t intend to be snobbish, though he says
I am, but that&rsquo;s just my way somehow, unless I happen
to like a person. Mort is different from me; he will get
along with all sorts of people, you know, but I never
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all right,&rdquo; answered Houston, &ldquo;you are a
little conscious of your blue blood now and then, but as
you grow older you will think less about that, and you
have as good a heart as Morton, when a person is fortunate
enough to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Rutherford, suddenly, &ldquo;if you and Mort
were class mates, you must have known Van Dorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Houston, smilingly watching the
blue coils of smoke from his cigar, &ldquo;and when I first saw
him with the Winters party, I knew my little game was
up, unless I got my work in very expeditiously,&rdquo; and
he described the little pantomime which took place in
the office shortly after Van Dorn&rsquo;s arrival, much to the
amusement of Rutherford, who exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! but you fellows played that game well,
no one ever would have dreamed that you had known
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston then told of the plan for Van Dorn&rsquo;s coming
in a few weeks, and later, for the arrival of Mr. Cameron
with Lindlay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Rutherford exclaimed, &ldquo;now I see why Mort
is so anxious to get here at just about a certain time;
he knows all about this, and wants to be in at the death
himself; well, that suits me exactly. But say, old fellow,
isn&rsquo;t this going to be a pretty nasty piece of business
for you about that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be if any one should get hold of this before
the right time comes, but I do not anticipate any trouble,
because I intend to be so guarded that nothing regarding
my work will be known or suspected until my uncle
is here, and we have them securely trapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will require a cool head and a level one to carry
this thing through, and accomplish what you have undertaken,&rdquo;
said Rutherford thoughtfully, as he took
one or two turns up and down the room, &ldquo;and I guess
you are the right one for the work. Van Dorn will be
just the one to help you, too, he&rsquo;s pretty cool and quick-witted
himself, but I should think you would both need a
third party, somebody who has been on the ground for a
long time and who understands all about the working
of these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be of great assistance to us, and I intend to
keep a look-out, and if it is possible to find such a person,
and one whom we can trust at the same time, I shall
secure him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I wish you success, and I shall be
anxious to hear from you while I&rsquo;m gone, and know
how you are coming on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smoked silently for a few moments, then Rutherford
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Houston, how about the congratulations
I told you some time ago I was ready to offer whenever
the occasion required; are they in order now? or shall
I reserve them until my return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in order whenever you choose to offer
them,&rdquo; Houston replied quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, I thought it about
time. I congratulate you most heartily, and tender you
both my sincerest wishes for your happiness. I tell you
what, old fellow, I think you&rsquo;ve found a splendid woman,
and I think, too, that you are wonderfully suited to each
other. Seems strange, doesn&rsquo;t it? to think of a pair like
you two, finding each other in a place like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather unusual, I admit,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Rutherford, &ldquo;taking into consideration
all the surroundings, and the why and wherefore of your
coming here, I think it borders on the romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later he asked, &ldquo;Does Miss Gladden know
what you are doing out here?&rdquo; Houston shook his
head, in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she know who you really are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Houston answered, &ldquo;no one out here
knows any more about that than you did two hours
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Rutherford, &ldquo;she will be slightly surprised
when she finds that old Blaisdell&rsquo;s clerk and bookkeeper
has a few cool millions of his own, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she will not object to the millions,&rdquo; said
Houston with a smile, &ldquo;but I have the satisfaction of
knowing that they were not the chief attraction; she
cares for me myself, and for my own sake, not for the
sake of my wealth, and I am just old fashioned enough
to consider that of first importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will she learn your secret? not until the
closing scene of the last act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell just when,&rdquo; Houston answered, &ldquo;that
will of course depend a great deal upon circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rutherford then became confidential regarding his
own hopes for the future, and gave Houston a description
of his fiancee, and a brief history of their acquaintance
and engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace is all right,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;but her
father is inclined to be a little old-fogyish, thinks we are
too young for any definite engagement, and wants me to
be permanently established in some business before we
are married, and all that; when I can&rsquo;t see what in the
deuce is the difference so long as I have plenty of stuff.
So the upshot of it all was that he and his wife took
Grace to Europe, and they&rsquo;re not coming back until the
holidays, and if, by that time, we have neither of us
changed our minds, and I am settled in business and all
that sort of thing, we can be married. There&rsquo;s no danger
of our changing our minds, so that&rsquo;s all right, but
I declare I don&rsquo;t see the use of a fellow&rsquo;s tying himself
down to some hum-drum business, when there&rsquo;s no need
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bad idea though to find some business for
which you are adapted, and stick to it,&rdquo; was Houston&rsquo;s
reply; &ldquo;that was the advice my uncle gave me when I
returned from college, and he offered me the choice of
going into business with himself, or selecting something
else that I liked better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace&rsquo;s father wants me to go in with him, but excuse
me; if I went into business with any one, it would
be somebody nearer my own age, where I&rsquo;d have about
as much to say as the other fellow, not an old man, and
my father-in-law, in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may find something you will like, within the
next few months,&rdquo; said Houston, with a peculiar smile;
&ldquo;By the way, Morton used to say he was going to stick
to journalistic work; how is he succeeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendidly; you know he is one of the associate
editors of the Dispatch, then he contributes regularly to
several of the leading magazines, and lately he has some
work of his own on hand besides, a work on some sort
of scientific research: yes, he has succeeded well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So long did their conversation continue, that when
they at last went to rest, it was nearly time for the surrounding
peaks, standing like huge sentinels against
the dark, eastern sky, to catch the first faint flush of the
approaching day.</p>
<p>They were a little late in making their appearance in
the breakfast room. Miss Gladden and Lyle were awaiting
them, but the others had gone. There was time for
only a hasty breakfast before the team, going to the Y
for supplies, which had been engaged to take Rutherford
to the morning train, was at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter, having seen his baggage safely
aboard, including the familiar square case containing his
precious cameras, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a delightful time here, and
I&rsquo;m awfully glad I&rsquo;m coming back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we, Mr. Rutherford,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;and
we will be very glad to welcome your brother also, and
do all in our power to make his visit a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is doubtful whether he will ever want to leave
here,&rdquo; Rutherford responded, &ldquo;for he appreciates anything
of this kind even more than I do. He&rsquo;ll grow wild
over these mountains. Well, Miss Maverick,&rdquo; he continued,
shaking hands with Lyle, &ldquo;I thank you for all
you&rsquo;ve done to make my visit so pleasant, and I&rsquo;m glad
that we will only say good-bye for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am also,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I wish you a pleasant
journey and a speedy return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not &lsquo;good-bye,&rsquo; Mr. Rutherford,&rdquo; said Miss
Gladden, extending her hand, &ldquo;it is only &lsquo;au revoir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; he answered, then added in low tones,
&ldquo;Miss Gladden, I have already congratulated Mr. Houston,
and I hope you will accept my congratulations and
best wishes also. I think almost as much of him as of
my own brother, and I could not wish either of you
any happier fortune than I believe you will find in each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments Houston and Rutherford were riding
rapidly down the canyon. At the office, where
Houston had to prepare some orders for the driver, he
and Rutherford took leave of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good to yourself, old fellow,&rdquo; said Rutherford,
&ldquo;and keep us posted just how you are coming on; and
say,&rdquo; he added, lowering his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you posted
of our whereabouts, and if anything should happen, and
you need help, wire us and we&rsquo;ll be here by the next
train; you can count on two brothers now, instead of
one, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>A day or two after the departure of Rutherford, Miss
Gladden, having learned from Lyle at what hour Jack
usually completed his day&rsquo;s work, set forth upon her
visit to the cabin. She felt that her errand might prove
embarrassing both to Jack and herself; she wished to
obtain some clue regarding Lyle&rsquo;s parentage; at least,
to learn what his suspicions, or possible knowledge
might be concerning the matter, and taking into consideration
the contingency that she might be his own
child, whose existence he had kept secret for reasons of
his own, it was a subject which would require very delicate
handling.</p>
<p>She found Jack at the cabin, and alone, and his courteous
greeting, containing less formality and more cordiality
and friendliness than on the former occasion,
made her task seem far less difficult. He ushered her
into the pleasant little sitting-room, and she noted even
more particularly than on her former visit, the exquisite
taste betrayed, not only in the furnishings of the room,
but in their very arrangement.</p>
<p>After chatting a few moments regarding the little circle
of friends at the house, in whom he seemed to take
more interest than she would have expected from a man
of his secluded life, the conversation naturally turned to
Lyle, and Miss Gladden said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wished to see you regarding her because you
seem to be the only one among those living here who
appreciates her ability, or cares for her welfare; and you
have known her and her surroundings so long, I believed
you could give me some suggestions and advice
regarding what is best to be done for her, even now,
while she remains here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken a great interest in the child ever since I
have known her,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;and I am only too glad
that she has found another friend, and that friend a lady;
and if I can assist, by suggestion or otherwise, I shall be
most happy to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked your opinion the other evening,&rdquo; continued
Miss Gladden, &ldquo;as to taking her east with me, but there
were other matters pertaining to her welfare, on which
I wished your opinion and advice, but I could not so well
speak of them before her, so I asked for this interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden hesitated a moment, almost hoping that
Jack might make some remark which would give her a
cue as to the best method for her to pursue in seeking
the information she desired, but his attitude was that of
respectful attention, and he was evidently waiting for
her to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have felt attracted toward Lyle from the first,&rdquo; she
began slowly, &ldquo;not alone by her wondrous beauty and
grace of manner, but even more by her intelligence and
intellectual ability, her natural refinement and delicacy,
which, considering her surroundings, seemed to me simply
inexplicable. From the very first, she has been to
me a mystery, and as I become better acquainted with
her, the mystery, instead of being lessened, is only deepened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, but he offered no comment, only bowed
gravely for her to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not, and I cannot yet, understand how one
like her could ever have been born, or could exist in
such surroundings as hers; and the fact that she has
existed here, her beautiful nature untainted, unsullied by
the coarseness, the vulgarity and the immorality about
her, to me seemed an indication that she was of an altogether
different type, born in another and far higher
sphere. I saw she was unhappy, and I determined to
win her confidence, and in so doing, from a vague suspicion
I have gradually arrived at a firm conviction that
Lyle is not the child of those whom she calls her
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack manifested no surprise, neither was there anything
in his manner to indicate that this was a subject
upon which he had any knowledge. He simply asked
very calmly,&ndash;&ndash;almost indifferently it seemed to Miss
Gladden,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you discovered any direct evidence in support
of this conviction that she is not their child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No tangible evidence,&rdquo; replied Miss Gladden, &ldquo;nothing,
of course, that could be called proof, but there are
what I consider very strong indications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the indications on Lyle&rsquo;s part, or on the part
of Mr. and Mrs. Maverick?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On both sides,&rdquo; replied Miss Gladden, &ldquo;I have very
little to say regarding Mrs. Maverick; she is a kind-hearted
woman, and seems to treat Lyle with consideration
and some degree of affection; there is very little of
the latter, but perhaps it is all of which she is capable,
for I should think life with that brute would quickly
crush out all the affection, if not all the intelligence, in
a woman&rsquo;s nature; but the neglect and ill treatment of
Maverick himself towards Lyle surely indicate that she is
no child of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your remark regarding Mrs. Maverick might be
still more applicable to him, that he is incapable of anything
like affection or kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; replied Miss Gladden quickly, &ldquo;but
I can not conceive of a man being quite so low as to be
without even animal instincts; I cannot believe that a
father would insult and degrade his own daughter as he
has Lyle, and as he would continue to do, if he were not
restrained through fear of his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Jack started. &ldquo;Fear of his wife,
did you say, Miss Gladden? Pardon me, but I think
that brute fears neither God, man nor devil, and how you
can assert that he is in fear of his wife, whom he has always
abused mercilessly, I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fact, nevertheless; for one morning after he
had been exceedingly abusive and insulting in his language
toward Lyle, Mrs. Maverick told her that he was,
in some way, in her power, and that it should never occur
again; and it never has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rose, and began to pace the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear her say that, Miss Gladden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lyle told me of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Lyle any idea of what she meant by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not seem to have; nothing was ever said regarding
that phase of the subject; she only seemed relieved
that Mrs. Maverick promised to prevent a repetition
of her father&rsquo;s abuse of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack seated himself. &ldquo;You spoke of some reasons on
Lyle&rsquo;s part for your conclusions; what were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden then told him of Lyle&rsquo;s strange impressions
and of her dream, but made no allusion to the photograph,
wishing to reserve that until later.</p>
<p>Jack looked thoughtful. &ldquo;I wonder that she has never
spoken to me regarding this dream,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me she had not had the dream so often since
having been occupied with her studies and reading, probably
that accounts for her not speaking of it; lately she
says it has returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were silent for a while, then Miss Gladden asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not think these dreams and impressions are
indications of an early life, far different from this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he replied gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my opinion,&rdquo; then, determined to get some
expression from him, she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so attached to her, so desirous, if possible, to
rescue her from this wretched life, that I am anxious to
get some clue as to her true parentage; that is why I
have come to you, her friend. I thought possibly you
might be able to aid me in getting some evidence, or
some information regarding her early history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was watching Jack keenly, to note if her
words produced any effect on that immobile face. She
was not disappointed: he started, almost imperceptibly,
and as he fixed his dark eyes upon her own, she noticed,
as never before, how keen and piercing, and how eloquently
beautiful they were. Miss Gladden&rsquo;s eyes did
not drop before his searching gaze; she was determined
that he should read only sincerity and candor in their
depths, and make his answer accordingly. When he
spoke, his voice was unlike its usual smooth, even tone;
it was tender and deep, full of some strange emotion, and
reminded her wonderfully of her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gladden, may I ask,&ndash;&ndash;for I believe you will answer
me truthfully and candidly,&ndash;&ndash;what ever led you to
suppose that I could give you any information regarding
Lyle&rsquo;s early history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer you candidly, as you wish,&rdquo; she replied;
&ldquo;the thought first occurred to me of coming to you for
advice regarding Lyle, simply because I regarded you
as her best friend, in fact, until I came, her only friend.
Then a remark accidently dropped by Lyle, as to what
you had once said of her singing, that it reminded you
of but one voice which you had heard, but that you did
not like to hear her, led me to think that perhaps she was
in some way connected with some one you had known,
and that possibly that was the reason for the special interest
you took in her welfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was something more, in connection with
her dream,&rdquo; and she told him how Lyle had at last identified
the pictured face which seemed so familiar to her,
as the dream-face of her childhood, and how immediately
after the dream had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After she told me this,&rdquo; continued Miss Gladden,
&ldquo;you will see that I naturally concluded that the face was
that of her mother; that her mother, her parents, and
probably her early life were known to you; and I will
frankly admit, that except that it seemed incredible that
you would allow her to remain in these surroundings, if
my hypothesis were correct, I would have believed that
you were her father, and that grief from bereavement or
separation, had caused you to choose this life for yourself
and her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had again risen and was slowly pacing the room.
Miss Gladden could read no sign of displeasure in his face,
though she detected indications of some powerful emotion,
and of acute suffering. He seemed battling with
old-time memories, and when at last he seated himself
and began speaking, there was a strange pathos vibrating
through the forced calmness of his voice, and the
piercing eyes, now looking so kindly into her own, had
in their depths such hopeless sadness, that Miss Gladden&rsquo;s
heart was stirred by a pity deeper than she had ever
known, for she instinctively felt that she was in the presence
of some great, despairing sorrow.</p>
<p>With a smile of rare sweetness and beauty, he said:
&ldquo;Your candor and frankness deserve confidence in return,
and I will give it so far as it is within my power to do so,
and yet I fear that you will be disappointed. Your surmises
are incorrect in many respects, and yet contain a
great deal of truth, and I will try, so far as possible, to
be as frank with you as you have been with me. In the
first place, I must say to you, that regarding Lyle&rsquo;s true
parentage, whether or not she is the child of the Mavericks,
I know, positively, nothing more than do you,
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled as he noted Miss Gladden&rsquo;s look of astonishment,
and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you, I have my suspicions that she is not their
child, and have had them since first seeing her, years ago.
As in your case, my suspicions long ago changed to conviction,
and my convictions are probably even deeper
than yours, for the reason, that in form, in feature, in
voice and manner, in every expression and gesture,&rdquo; his
voice trembled for an instant, but he controlled it, &ldquo;she
is the exact counterpart of another; some one whom I
knew in a life as remote, as far from this as it is possible
to conceive. But I have no direct proof, not a shadow of
tangible evidence with which I could confront Maverick
and denounce him with having stolen the child, and,
knowing him as I do, I know that for Lyle&rsquo;s sake, until
I have some such proof, it were better to remain silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me for interrupting you,&rdquo; Miss Gladden exclaimed,
&ldquo;but that is a contingency that never entered my
mind, that Lyle had been stolen from her parents! That
is far worse than anything I had dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, if she is not their child, she was stolen,
and just in proportion as the former is improbable, the
latter is probable, almost certain. You will now see
wherein your supposition that my interest in her was due
to her connection in my mind with some one I had formerly
known, was correct. I took a special interest in her
for this reason; it was a pleasure to teach her, to note her
mind expanding so rapidly, to watch her as she developed
physically and mentally; every day growing more and
more like the one I had known. I enjoyed tracing the
resemblance day by day, though it often caused me almost
as much pain as pleasure,&ndash;&ndash;but when I heard her
sing, that was too much,&ndash;&ndash;it was more than I could
bear,&ndash;&ndash;it was like compelling some lost soul in purgatory
to listen to the songs of paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tremor in Jack&rsquo;s voice, and he paused,
touched even more deeply by the sympathetic tears glistening
in the beautiful eyes full of such tender pity, than by
the bitter memories passing before his own mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has perplexed me most,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is the
fact that Lyle has seemed unable to recall anything relating
to her early childhood. I have tried in every way
to arouse her memory, and that was my chief object in
allowing her to see the photograph of which she told
you; but, as she often says, the first few years of her life
seem to be only blank. I cannot account for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;these dreams of hers show
that there are memories there, and something may yet recall
them to her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That has been my hope,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that is what I
have been waiting for all these years, for her mind to recall
some incident, or some individual, that would furnish
the needed proof as to her parentage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; asked Miss Gladden, after a pause,
&ldquo;that it would be wise to give Lyle a hint of our suspicions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought it might be well, if possible, to arouse
her own suspicions by some process of reasoning on her
part, not by any suggestions of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire whether those whom you consider her
true parents are still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both died many years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if her identity could be proven beyond a doubt,
would there be any one to give her such a home as she
ought to have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are those who would be only too glad to
give her such a home as very few have the good fortune
to possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have they never made any inquiry for her?&rdquo; Miss
Gladden asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no idea that she is living; her parents died
under peculiar circumstances, and she was supposed to
have died at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ought we not,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden thoughtfully,
&ldquo;both for her sake and theirs, to let them know that she
is living, and help them to find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless they could see her for themselves,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;they would probably be rather skeptical, and require
very positive proof regarding her claims, they have believed
her dead for so many years. But even though I
may have known Lyle&rsquo;s mother, I am not in communication
with her friends, and would not be the proper person
to present her claims to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments, Miss Gladden sat silently watching
the play of the light and shade on the mountain side
across the ravine, opposite the cabin, as the shadows cast
by the light, floating clouds, followed each other in rapid
succession.</p>
<p>Jack seemed to be thinking deeply, and when he at
last spoke, it was with great deliberation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time, as I have become more and more
convinced of Lyle&rsquo;s identity, I have been anxious to have
her taken away from these surroundings, and placed in
the home to which I believe she has a right; but without
tangible evidence with which to establish her claims, and
also to prove Maverick&rsquo;s guilt, I could think of no feasible
plan, nothing that did not seem likely to result in failure,
and leave Lyle possibly in a worse condition than at
present. I will now say to you, Miss Gladden, in confidence,
that I think before very long, the way will be
opened for Lyle to find the home and friends that I consider
are really hers. Through information given me in
confidence, I have learned that some of those whom I believe
to be most closely related to her and who would
be most interested in her, did they know of her existence,
will in all probability be out here on business this summer;
if they do not recognize Lyle, I shall be greatly disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden&rsquo;s face expressed the delight she felt. &ldquo;Is
it possible?&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, I cannot conceive of
anything lovelier! If she has been stolen all these years,
and her people unconscious of her very existence, to have
them appear on the scene, and recognize and claim her,
will seem like a beautiful bit of fiction interwoven in our
prosaic, every-day life, or like the closing scene in some
drama, where the wrongs at last are all made right. To
think what happiness it will bring to them, to her and to
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face grew strangely serious. &ldquo;I shall be glad for
her sake;&rdquo; he replied, then added: &ldquo;Sometimes, Miss
Gladden, wrongs are righted only at a terrible cost, and
what seems to you like the closing of a peaceful drama,
may prove a tragedy to those who are concerned in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before she could reply, he said, in a different
tone, as though to change the conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be best to mention what I have told you to
any one; there is no knowing what course Maverick
might pursue if he had a hint of it, for he is a desperate
man; but if there is any way in which Lyle&rsquo;s mind could
be carried back and made to recall something of her past
life, I wish it might be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden had risen, preparatory to taking leave.
Having given a searching glance around the room, she
turned toward Jack, saying wistfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I asking too much? Could I see the photograph
which you allowed Lyle to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Jack hesitated; then he replied, &ldquo;I am
willing you should see it, but you must not expect me to
say anything concerning that picture or myself. I have
spoken to you in confidence regarding Lyle, but I can go
no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not ask it,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Without a word, he went to a small trunk, concealed by
a fine bear-skin, and taking therefrom the picture, silently
handed it to Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>She uttered a low cry of surprise, and then stood for
some time intently studying the lovely face in every detail.
When she returned the picture to Jack&rsquo;s hands, there were
tears in her eyes, as she exclaimed, &ldquo;How beautiful! and
how like Lyle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped she would see the resemblance,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost incredible that she did not,&rdquo; answered
Miss Gladden, &ldquo;except for the fact that she has the least
self-consciousness of any one I ever saw; it is doubtful
if she would recognize her own picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time Jack stood watching Miss Gladden, as,
having thanked him for the interview, she walked slowly
up the winding road. His eyes grew strangely wistful
and tender, very unlike their ordinary expression, and a
smile, sad but sweet, played about the usually stern lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has chosen well,&rdquo; he murmured at length, &ldquo;they
are well suited to each other; Heaven grant nothing may
ever mar their happiness!&rdquo; and with a heavy sigh, he
turned and entered the cabin.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_XXV' id='CHAPTER_XXV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Miss Gladden slowly followed the winding canyon
road on her return from the little cabin, the thoughts
flashing through her mind very strongly resembled the
lights and shadows which she had watched chasing each
other across the mountain side. While she had gained
very little direct information, Jack&rsquo;s theories had strengthened
her own convictions, though placing the matter in a
slightly different light. She had a very vivid imagination,
and looked forward with anticipations of keenest pleasure
to the coming of Lyle&rsquo;s friends,&ndash;&ndash;whoever they might
be&ndash;&ndash;and their probable recognition of her; and yet she
could not forget Jack&rsquo;s words regarding the terrible cost
which might be involved, resulting in possible tragedy,
and an indefinable dread seemed at times to overshadow
all other thoughts, and perplex her. Not dreaming, however,
that the words could refer to herself, or those in
whom she was most deeply interested, she tried to banish
this feeling by planning what course would be best to
pursue regarding Lyle, and determined to confide the
whole matter to Houston, and ask his advice. So absorbed
was she in her own thoughts and plans, that not
until she had nearly approached the house, did she observe
the presence of strangers.</p>
<p>A party of eight or ten ladies and gentlemen, including
three or four tourists from the east, had come out from
Silver City. They had come with wagons, bringing a
large tent which was to be put up for those who could not
be accommodated in the house. They proved to be very
pleasant people, and during the ensuing ten days of their
stay, Miss Gladden and Lyle seldom saw each other apart
from their guests. There were numerous excursions to
various points of interest, moonlight rides on the lake
and impromptu dances.</p>
<p>Houston at this time was more than usually occupied,
as the day after the arrival of the camping party, Mr.
Blaisdell unexpectedly appeared upon the scene. He arrived
quite early in the morning, having been brought by
special train from the Y. He found Houston alone in
the office, and greeted him with a cordiality quite surprising
to the latter, considering his taciturn, dissatisfied manner
when at the mines a few days before. He seemed in
no hurry to leave the office, but remained talking for
some time concerning business affairs at Silver City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may want you to run over there, just for a day,
while I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;for I expect to remain
out here for about a week. By the way, Houston, I hear
you pitched into old Hartwell one night, over there at
the hotel, for some remarks he made about the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;how did you hear of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a friend of mine there, who overheard
Hartwell&rsquo;s talk, and afterward saw you go up and speak
to him. Having seen you in our office, he had a little
curiosity as to what was going on. He said Hartwell
cursed you up hill and down, but that you were so
damned cool the old fellow couldn&rsquo;t rattle you. Hartwell
told him afterward that you threatened to compel
him to substantiate all he had said, and he was glad that
the old fellow, for once, found somebody that wasn&rsquo;t
afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Houston, quietly, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any reason
for being afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;I liked your spirit all right,
but then, men like Hartwell are not worth paying any attention
to. He is interested in another company, so of
course he tries to run down ours, and he has a certain
clique that he has persuaded to think just as he does. I
never think it best to notice any of his remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had simply made a few remarks,&rdquo; said Houston
in reply, &ldquo;I would of course have let them remain unnoticed,
but he had continued his harangue for nearly an
hour before I spoke to him, so I thought it as well to have
a word with him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was all right, perfectly right on your part,
only I have adopted the policy of letting barking dogs
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little further conversation, Mr. Blaisdell looked
over the books, and finding everything in satisfactory
shape, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have familiarized yourself very thoroughly
with the work so far as you have gone, and in a very
short time. You will doubtless remember, Mr. Houston,
that when we engaged you, you were told that we should
probably need your services later at the mines, in assisting
the general superintendent. Morgan&rsquo;s work is increasing
lately, and I have been thinking that I would
much prefer to have a trustworthy person like yourself,
assist him, even if we have to employ another bookkeeper,
than to put on an entirely new man at the mines. I am
going out to the mines this afternoon, to see how Morgan
is getting along, and I think that to-morrow we will
close the office, and you had better go out with me, and
I will show you the work that I wish you to have charge
of there. It probably will not take all your time, you will
still be in the office more or less, at least enough to superintend
the work in case I bring out a new man. He will
simply work under your direction and supervision, the
responsibility will all devolve upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next day or two, Houston&rsquo;s time was spent at
the mines, familiarizing himself with the underground
workings, and becoming acquainted with the different
classes and grades of ore, and the various methods of mining
and reducing the same.</p>
<p>This was just the opportunity for which Houston had
been waiting, and he entered upon his new work with a
zest and enthusiasm that delighted Mr. Blaisdell, and
even won the esteem of Morgan. On the second day, to
Houston&rsquo;s great joy, he was given charge, under Morgan,
of what was known as the &ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; group of mines, containing
the Yankee Boy, the Yankee Girl and the Puritan,
the three most valuable mines in which the New
York company was interested.</p>
<p>In passing through one of these mines, Houston noticed
two miners working together with wonderful precision
and accuracy, and on looking at them closely, recognized
in one of them, the man whom Rutherford had
pointed out to him on the train from Valley City, and of
whom he had heard Miss Gladden speak as Lyle&rsquo;s friend.
The man seemed to pay little attention to his being there,
and on coming out, Houston inquired of Mr. Blaisdell
concerning him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you nothing about him,&rdquo; replied Mr. Blaisdell,
&ldquo;except that he and his partner, the Irishman, are
the two most expert miners we have. They live by themselves,
and refuse to mingle with the other men, consequently
they are not very popular among the miners, but
of course that cuts no figure with us, so long as they are
skilled workmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, Houston went to Silver City, on business
for Mr. Blaisdell, and while there, sent the following
message over the wires, to Van Dorn:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in readiness; bring machinery at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon his return to the mining camp to enter upon his
new duties, Houston resolved to make a careful study of
the men working under him, both foremen and miners,
for the purpose of determining whether there were among
them any whom he could trust sufficiently to seek from
them whatever assistance might be necessary for himself
and Van Dorn in their future work.</p>
<p>Accordingly, for the first few days, he spent considerable
time in the mines, apparently examining the workings,
but in reality watching the men themselves. Among some
of them he saw black looks and scowls, and heard muttered
comments regarding himself: &ldquo;Git onto the dude!&rdquo;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see the tenderfoot?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thinks he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to boss
us, does he? we&rsquo;ll show him a trick or two.&rdquo; These were
mainly from Maverick&rsquo;s consorts, and men of their ilk,
ignorant and brutal. Houston paid no attention to their
remarks or frowns, but continued his rounds among them,
conscious that he was master of the situation, meanwhile
giving instructions to the foreman who accompanied him.
As he passed and repassed Jack and Mike, working together
with almost the automatic precision of machinery,
he stopped to watch them, attracted partly by admiration
for their work, and partly by a slight interest in the
man who had been his fellow passenger, and concerning
whom he had heard such various reports.</p>
<p>During the slight pause in their work, the Irishman
eyed him curiously, with indications of his native drollery
and humor betraying themselves in his mirthful face; he
seemed about to speak, but Jack, with set, stern features,
was ready, and the work continued without a word. In
that brief interim, however, Jack had fixed one of his
keen, piercing glances upon Houston, which the latter returned
with one equally searching, and though not a
muscle relaxed in that immobile face, covered with dust
and grime, yet a strange thrill of mutual sympathy quivered
and vibrated through the soul of each man, and
Houston knew that he had found a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a man among a thousand,&rdquo; he thought as he
walked away, &ldquo;a man of honor, in whom one could place
unbounded confidence; no wonder Lyle has found him
such a friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next pause in their work, Mike&rsquo;s feelings found
expression:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begorra! but the young mon is progressin&rsquo; foinely, to
be put over the loikes of us, and bein&rsquo; as how most loikely
he niver sit foot in a moine, till comin&rsquo; out into this counthry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face had grown strangely set and white: &ldquo;We
are to be his friends, remember that, Mike,&rdquo; he said, in
a voice unnaturally stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frinds!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Mike, &ldquo;Be-dad!
and whin did I iver know ye to make frinds with ony of
owld Blaisdell&rsquo;s men befoor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, Mike,&rdquo;
was Jack&rsquo;s only reply as he again began work, and Mike
had nothing to do but to follow his example.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>In a short time Houston had become perfectly familiar
with his new surroundings. He was thoroughly at home
in the underground workings, readily finding his way in
the labyrinth of shafts, tunnels and cross-cuts extending
for miles in all directions, and connecting the various mining
claims one with another.</p>
<p>He knew the name and face of nearly every man employed
in the various shifts, and by his keen perception
and insight, was able to form a very correct estimate of
their character and standing in that little community.
Though no words had been exchanged between himself
and Jack beyond those of the most commonplace greetings,
yet his respect for the man, and confidence in him,
increased with each day, and was plainly indicated by his
manner toward him whenever they met.</p>
<p>As he watched the men, in his frequent rounds through
the mines, most of their faces were to him as an open
book, on some of whose pages he read histories of misfortune
and loss, or crime and shame in the past, and on
others, of eager ambitions and bright hopes for the future.
There were men with gray hair and bowed forms,
whose dull eyes and listless step told of hopeless, irretrievable
loss; men of intelligence and ability whose recklessness
or whose despondency told of some living sorrow,
worse than death; there were some whose stealthy,
shrinking gait and watchful, suspicious glance bespoke
some crime, unknown to their fellows, but which to
themselves seemed ever present, suspended, like the
sword of Damocles, above their heads.</p>
<p>But even to Houston, Jack remained a mystery, and
as he noted the powerful, athletic form, the profile of patrician
beauty, perfect as though chiseled in marble, the
hair and beard black and glossy as the raven&rsquo;s wing,
though touched with silver here and there, he found himself
unable to read the history of that life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a man,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;my equal, if not
my superior, in birth, in education, in intellectual ability;
how came he here? What has wrecked his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dark, piercing eyes, turned on him for an instant,
gave no answer to his query.</p>
<p>As he and Morgan, their day&rsquo;s work completed, were
returning to the house, Houston made some inquiries regarding
the men, and from the information given by Morgan
concerning some of them, found his own judgment
of them correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is the man called &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; who works with
the Irishman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows, I don&rsquo;t, nor nobody else,&rdquo; replied
Morgan; &ldquo;he came here about six or seven years ago,
I guess, at least; he was here when I came, and was considered
an expert then. He never would have anything
to say to the other men, and always lived by himself till
the Irishman came; he was another queer sort of duck
and was a first-class miner, too, so him and Jack has
worked together and lived together ever since, but Jack
is boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they the only miners living by themselves?&rdquo;
asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only single men; there&rsquo;s six or seven of &rsquo;em that
are married and have families, like Maverick; they have
very good shacks, furnished by the company, but all the
single men, excepting them two, live at the quarters. By
the way, have you ever been down to the quarters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;but I should like very well to
visit them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll go to-night if you like; I go down
there myself once in a while and listen to their stories;
they&rsquo;ve most of &rsquo;em had some queer experiences, and
they can spin as many yarns as a lot of sailors, any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the evening, Houston, having excused himself
to the ladies in general, and Miss Gladden in particular,
accompanied by Morgan, was on his way to the miners&rsquo;
quarters. The latter were situated but a short distance
from the office, on the road to the mines, and consisted
of two boarding houses and four bunk houses.
Farther down the road were the stables for the horses
used in hauling supplies; also blacksmith and carpenter
shops, and a storehouse.</p>
<p>A rather novel scene presented itself to Houston as he
approached. Scattered about on the ground, and loafing
in the door-ways in all attitudes and positions, were over
a hundred men, of various ages, classes and nationalities,
but principally Cornishmen, or, in western vernacular,
&ldquo;Cousin Jacks.&rdquo; Many of them were strangers to him,
being employed in other mines than those with which he
was familiar, but among them were many of his own men.
From the door-way of one of the bunk houses came the
strains of a violin, while in another, a concertina shrieked
and groaned, and from all directions came the sound of
ribald songs, coarse jests and boisterous laughter. Here
and there were groups of men engaged in playing poker
or seven-up, where little piles of silver and gold were
rapidly changing hands, to the accompaniment of muttered
oaths. At one side, Maverick and a few kindred
spirits seemed trying to outrival one another in profanity
and obscenity, while at some distance from them, was a
large company of the better class of men, some lounging
against trees and rocks, some sitting or lying at full length
on the ground, but all listening with unmistakable
interest, to a man, gray and grizzled, with a weather-beaten
but kindly face, who evidently was entertaining
the crowd with tales of his own early life.</p>
<p>As Houston and Morgan approached, the speaker
stopped; some of the men half rose from their recumbent
positions out of respect for the &ldquo;new boss,&rdquo; and all eyed
him rather curiously, though not unkindly. Houston
recognized many of his own men among them, and
greeted them with a pleasant &ldquo;Good evening, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Billy,&rdquo; said Morgan, addressing the old miner,
&ldquo;what do you know to-night?&rdquo; then noting that he was
watching Houston with a half smile on his rugged face,
he added, &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d bring the boss down to see you
and the rest of the boys to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo; boss,&rdquo; responded the old fellow, while a
merry smile twinkled in his eyes, &ldquo;I expect this is your
first visit to a reg&rsquo;lar, genuwine minin&rsquo; camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first, perhaps, but not my last,&rdquo; said Houston,
with a winning smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the old man approvingly, as he proceeded
to refill his pipe; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a watchin&rsquo; you, off
and on, down there at the mines, bein&rsquo; as I&rsquo;d heerd you
was a tenderfoot, and I must say you&rsquo;ve took a holt as if
you was an old hand at the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;with a little determination,
a person can pick up anything of that kind easily.
I think, with a little practice, I could make a pretty successful
miner; it would require grit and stick-to-it-ativeness,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Grit and stick-to-it-ativeness,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said the
old miner, highly pleased, &ldquo;well, you seem to have plenty
of &rsquo;em both, and plenty of good muscle, too,&rdquo; with an admiring
glance at Houston&rsquo;s fine, athletic form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Billy,&rdquo; said Houston pleasantly, after chatting
a few moments, &ldquo;when we came, it looked very much
as though you were telling stories to the crowd here, and
the boys all seemed very much interested; now we want
you to go on with your story, we would enjoy it as much
as the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember just where
I was, but I guess I&rsquo;d finished as you come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you can start another,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Billy, give us another,&rdquo; chimed in the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, pardner,&rdquo; added Morgan, &ldquo;spin us a yarn,
that&rsquo;s what we came for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only tellin&rsquo; the boys about the old days when I
came out to the mines, and for the first few years after,&rdquo;
Billy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those must have been interesting times,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Int&rsquo;restin&rsquo;? I should say so! You fellows don&rsquo;t know
nothin&rsquo; about minin&rsquo; compared to them days; I tell you,
things was lively then. I was there at Leadville when it
was opened up, and you couldn&rsquo;t get anybody to look at
you without payin&rsquo; &rsquo;em a good, round sum for it; couldn&rsquo;t
get a place to roll yourself in your blanket and lie on the
floor short of five or ten dollars; folks bought dry goods
boxes and lived in &rsquo;em. Then I was down here when they
opened up the Big Bonanza mine, in Diamond gulch, not
far from Silver City. I tell you boys, them was high old
times, everything was scarce and prices was high,&ndash;&ndash;flour
was a hundred dollars a sack, and potatoes seventy-five
dollars a bushel,&ndash;&ndash;but money was plenty,&ndash;&ndash;or gold dust,&ndash;&ndash;we
didn&rsquo;t have no money, everything was paid for in
gold dust. &rsquo;Twas pretty tough in them days, too, everybody
went armed to the teeth, and guns and knives was
used pretty free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that in the days of the vigilantes?&rdquo; asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they come along soon after, they had to. There
was desperate characters here, but the vigilantes made
short work of &rsquo;em, they didn&rsquo;t even give &rsquo;em time to say
their prayers. I tell you, the gambling houses and the
dance halls, and all them places was lively in them days.
There wasn&rsquo;t many words over a game, if any quarrels
come up, they was settled pretty quick with the revolver
or bowie knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been some high stakes played in
those days,&rdquo; Houston remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High? well, yes, rather; I&rsquo;ve seen men sit down to a
game worth anywhere from fifty to two or three hundred
thousand, and get up without a cent in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused to relight his pipe, and having
puffed reflectively for a few moments, settled himself with
the air of a man who has a long story to tell, and the surrounding
miners evidently so understood it, for they
shifted their positions accordingly, and prepared to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speakin&rsquo; of gamblin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;puts me in mind of
something that happened among the camps on the other
side of the range, nigh onto fifteen years ago. A gang of
us boys was in Dandy Jim&rsquo;s gambling hall one night.
The place was crowded, I remember, and we was all tryin&rsquo;
to make our fortunes on the high card. Some of us
was dead broke, but them that hadn&rsquo;t the stuff borrowed
from them that had, sure of better luck next time. They
was all so deep in the game that none of &rsquo;em noticed a
seedy-lookin&rsquo; chap who come in, kinder quiet like, and set
down to the faro table and began to play. I guess I was
the only one who noticed him, and at first, I couldn&rsquo;t
make him out, but after a bit, I remembered him as &lsquo;Unlucky
Pete.&rsquo; That man had a history. When I first saw
him, some eight or ten years before that night, he had
just come west with his wife, a pretty little woman, and
had a good team of horses and a new wagon. He was
a reg&rsquo;lar border character, and whenever a new country
was opened up for settlement, him and his wife was the
first on the ground, ready to make a run to secure a home.
Pete was prosperous, till one night, in a quarrel over a
game of cards, he killed his man, and from that time his
luck changed. He secured one or two good claims, but
lost title to them; he lost his horses, and as fast as he
bought other horses, they died or was stolen, and everything
went against him. He wandered from one country
to another, but bad luck met him at every turn. The last
I seen him was some two years before; then him and his
wife and two or three babies was goin&rsquo; over the country
in an old, broken-down wagon. The wheels was held together
with wire and ropes, and the canvas top was in
rags and tatters; the horses was the poorest, skinniest
creatures you ever see, and him and his wife looked off
the same piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somehow or &rsquo;nuther, I knew him that night,
though he looked harder than ever, and had an old
slouched hat down over his face. He looked like a man
that was pushed pretty close to the wall, and had got down
to his last nickel. Well, he set down there to the table,
and threw a silver dollar on the high card; then pulled
that old hat down clean over his eyes, and never spoke,
or looked one way or another. The high card won, and
the dealer paid the bet, and pushed the money over to
Pete, but he never stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that high card kep&rsquo; a winnin&rsquo; till there was a
big pile of money there, but Pete, he never stirred, no
more&rsquo;n a stone. The dealer, he got mad and begun to
swear, but Pete didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody wake that fool up,&rsquo; says he, with an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow sittin&rsquo; next to Pete shook him, and then tore
off his hat. Well, boys, I&rsquo;ll never forget that sight, it
makes me sort o&rsquo; shiver now, when I think of it; there set
a dead man at the table before that pile of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dealer started to rake in that pile o&rsquo; money, but
about a dozen revolvers was p&rsquo;inted at him, and he decided
not to be in too big a hurry about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use anyway?&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;the man&rsquo;s dead and
the money&rsquo;s no good for him, and besides, nobody knows
who he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; says I, jumpin&rsquo; up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I,&rsquo; says another fellow, &lsquo;the man just come into
camp a day or two ago, and his family&rsquo;s starvin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we bundled that money up pretty sudden, and
a half a dozen of us started to find the folks; we found
&rsquo;em, too, but the wife was dead, starved to death, and
the children wouldn&rsquo;t have lasted much longer. The oldest,
a girl about eight years old, told that they had nothin&rsquo;
to eat for two days, and her father found the dollar,
and started down to the store for food, but soon after he
left the cabin, the mother died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We buried Pete and his wife in one grave, and then
with the pile of money we got good homes for the children,
and some of it was to be used in givin&rsquo; &rsquo;em a good
eddication, and the last I heerd, they was comin&rsquo; on well.
But I&rsquo;ve never set down to a game sence, that I haven&rsquo;t
thought of the night I played faro, with a dead man at
the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the old miner&rsquo;s story, a little suppressed
thrill of excitement ran through his audience.
Morgan, who had seemed restless and ill at ease, rose to
go, and Houston, finding it much later than he supposed,
after a few pleasant words with the boys, bade them good
night, and hastened after Morgan, who was already sauntering
up the road a little way in advance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan, as Houston overtook him, &ldquo;what
do you think of a &lsquo;genuwine minin&rsquo; camp,&rsquo; as Billy calls
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quarters are much more extensive than I supposed,&rdquo;
replied Houston, &ldquo;I never realized before that
there were so many men employed here; some of them
are good fellows, too, I enjoyed my visit to-night immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I generally like to come down and listen to them once
in a while,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;but somehow, I didn&rsquo;t care to
stay there to-night, that story of Billy&rsquo;s made me feel sort
of creepy; I&rsquo;m feeling a little off to-night, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a strange story the old fellow told, almost
bordering on the improbable, it seemed to me, but I suppose
there are a great many strange occurrences in a
country like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lots of things happen here, and folks think nothing
of &rsquo;em, that would be considered improbable anywhere
back east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from the east?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, part way,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;not from way back,
though, I&rsquo;ve never been farther east than Ohio. I was
born in Missouri, and raised in northern Iowa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, then continued: &ldquo;I believe
I told you one day that sometime I&rsquo;d give you a bit
of my life; I guess now&rsquo;s as good as any time, and when
you&rsquo;ve heard it, maybe you won&rsquo;t wonder at some of my
views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said, I was born in Missouri; when I was about
three years old, my folks moved to Iowa. I can just remember
my father being with us at that time, but I never
saw him after I was three and a half or so, and when I
got old enough to think about it and ask for him, mother
told me he was dead, and I never knew anything different
till years after. We were always moving, I remember,
from one place to another, and though we never had
any money saved up, yet we lived well and never wanted
for anything. Mother used to have a good deal of company,
and be away from home considerable, but she was
always kind to me, and I was a soft, warm-hearted, little
chap in those days, and I know I thought the world of
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lived together till I was about ten years old, and
then times began to get pretty close; mother didn&rsquo;t have
any money, and we had to pinch to get along, but she
was always good to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally she decided to go to Denver; said she had
heard of an opening there for her to run a boarding house
and make money, but she didn&rsquo;t want to take me with her,
and sent me to a brother of hers, living in Ohio. That
was the end of all happiness for me. He was a man old
enough to be my grandfather, for mother was the
youngest of a large family. He and his wife lived by
themselves, for they had no children, and a meaner,
stingier old couple never lived. Mother wrote pretty
often at first, and always sent money, but don&rsquo;t you think
I ever got any of it. They never mentioned my mother
to me, and they wouldn&rsquo;t let me speak of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things went on from bad to worse, and finally,
when I was fourteen, I run away. I stole rides on freight
cars when I could, and when I couldn&rsquo;t do that, I
tramped, till I got to St. Louis, and got a place there in
a third-class hotel as bell boy. While I was there, I
picked up a good many little accomplishments that have
stuck to me ever since, gambling and swearing, and so
on. I got to be pretty tough, I know, but in spite of it
all, there was one good spot about me yet,&ndash;&ndash;I thought
the world of my mother. I staid in St. Louis two years;
in that time I had only heard from mother twice, but she
sent me money both times, and wrote me kind letters,
though she never said anything about my coming to see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, they had reached the main road, and as
Morgan seated himself on a rock to finish his story,
Houston followed his example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made up my mind I wanted to see her, so I took
what little money I had saved up, about eighty dollars,
and started for Denver. The last letter I had from mother,
she said she was running a house on a certain street,
and I supposed of course it was a boarding house. I won&rsquo;t
tell you her real name; Morgan wasn&rsquo;t her name, nor
mine neither, I took it afterwards, but I&rsquo;ll call her name
Johnson. I got to Denver, and happened to meet an old
acquaintance of mine named Tim, who took me to a fifth-class
boarding and lodging house where he was staying.
Tim had only been in Denver a few days, and knew very
little of the city, but we found a crowd of old-timers at
the house, and after a while I asked for Mrs. Johnson who
kept a boarding house on such a street. The men all
laughed and began to guy me; I got hot and was going
to sail into them, but Tim persuaded me to go out with
him, and we started in to paint the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d been out about two or three hours, when
we came to a dancing hall, the toughest we&rsquo;d seen,&ndash;&ndash;a
regular dive,&ndash;&ndash;and we went in, bound to have some fun.
The place was full of tough-looking subs, and a lot of
frouzy, dowdy girls, and what they lacked in good looks
they made up in paint and brass,&ndash;&ndash;such brazen faces I
never saw. Half way down the hall was a big, fat woman,
with her hair blondined, who seemed to have charge of
the place, and was giving orders to the man behind the
bar. They had some loud talk, and something in her
voice took my attention, and I looked at her; just then
she turned &rsquo;round facing me, and great God! it was my
mother! I knew her in spite of the blond hair and the
paint, and she knew me. She gave one awful shriek, and
then fell in a dead faint, and when she came to half an
hour after, she went into hysterics, and screamed and
raved and cried nearly all night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so dazed, everything was going round and
round, and I thought the world was coming to an end;
and it would have been better for me if it had. The next
day, she was able to see me, and I went to her room, and
I guess I must have staid three or four hours. She told
me then, that her husband was living, but that he quit her
back in Iowa, and that he claimed I was not his child.
She cried and begged me to stay with her, but I left her
that day. That was fifteen years ago, and I have never
seen her since. From that time, the last tie that bound
me to even a belief in anything good was gone. I took
a different name, and came up here in this part of the
country. Once I found a girl I liked, but just as I began
to think something of her, I found she was like all the
rest of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve no faith in man or woman, and don&rsquo;t
believe there is any such thing as honor or virtue. If
there are some people who seem virtuous and honorable,
it is simply either because they have been so placed that
there was no temptation to be anything else, or because
they have succeeded in keeping up appearances a little
better than other folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Morgan paused, Houston spoke very slowly and
kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your experience has certainly been a sad one, Morgan,
and I am truly sorry for you; sorry most of all that
it has produced such an effect on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;I guess it don&rsquo;t make much difference,
one way or another, what we think or what we
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s opinions and actions seem to have
made considerable difference in your life,&rdquo; answered
Houston, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by George! I should say so!&rdquo; replied Morgan,
gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your opinions and your conduct are wrecking
some other life, in like manner. There is not one of us
who does not exert a powerful influence on those about
us, one way or the other, to build up and strengthen, or
to wreck and destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As there was no reply, Houston said: &ldquo;I am very glad
you have given me this sketch of your life, Morgan, I
shall always feel differently toward you, remembering
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morgan, rising, &ldquo;I wanted you to know,
and I thought this was as good a time as I would have.
You will remember it, whatever happens,&rdquo; he added ambiguously,
as he started slowly down the road, in an opposite
direction from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; asked Houston, also rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to the Y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! are you going that distance as late as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Morgan, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go all the way by the
road; there&rsquo;s a cut across that makes it a good deal
shorter, and I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both stood a few moments watching a tall, dark
figure that had been pacing up and down the road all the
time they had been talking, sometimes approaching quite
near, then retreating out of sight. They both recognized
it as Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer duck,&rdquo; muttered Morgan, &ldquo;wonder what
he&rsquo;s doing, this is rather late for a constitutional;&rdquo; then
added, &ldquo;I wish I had some of the money that chap&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, has he money?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;he never spends anything,
just hoards it up; he&rsquo;s got enough any way to help
me out just now, if I could only have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in need of money?&rdquo; asked Houston, quickly,
&ldquo;if so, I will gladly accommodate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; replied Morgan, starting down the
road, &ldquo;but I can get along for the present. Luck has been
against me a little lately, but I guess it will turn all right,&rdquo;
adding, as he looked back over his shoulder, &ldquo;if it don&rsquo;t
turn too late, like &lsquo;Unlucky Pete&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Houston walked rapidly up the canyon toward the
house, he saw Jack again approaching, and glad of an
opportunity to meet this man toward whom he felt such
a powerful attraction, he slackened his pace as Jack came
up, and greeting him cordially, stopped and entered into
conversation with him. To his surprise, he found Jack&rsquo;s
manner far less reserved than on the few occasions when
they had met in the mine. He seemed as ready to stop
as Houston himself, and though he spoke with a dignity
of tone and manner utterly unlike an employe, the icy reserve
was gone, and in its place, there was in his voice
the genuine ring of friendliness.</p>
<p>After a few moments of ordinary conversation, Jack
remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not often out in this locality at this hour, and
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;but I have been visiting the
miners in company with Morgan, and remained there
later than I intended. Then a talk with Morgan out there
among the rocks delayed me still longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but I suppose you are aware
that you have enemies here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, slightly surprised, &ldquo;I am conscious
of that fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Jack, lowering his tone, &ldquo;you are
probably also aware that this enmity is likely to increase,
so that unless you exercise great caution, your life will
be in danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston was startled, not so much by the suggestion
of personal danger, as by the thought that this man
seemed to understand something of his position there.
Was it possible his secret was known? It could not be,
but if it were,&ndash;&ndash;his nerves quivered, not with fear for himself,
but with apprehension lest his whole scheme should
in some way prove a failure.</p>
<p>These thoughts flashed through his mind with the
speed of lightning, but Jack was quick to read them, and
before Houston could make any reply, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire to have a private interview with you, as early
as possible, and as we will wish to be perfectly secure
from interruption, as well as from all danger of being
overheard, I wish you would come to my cabin, there we
can talk with perfect safety. And now, as a key to this
contemplated interview, allow me to say that I fully
understand your mission here; but have no fear, your
secret is absolutely safe. My only reason for wishing to
meet you is, that I desire to aid you if you will permit
me. Will you fix an evening for this conference of ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Houston cordially, his momentary
surprise giving way to the confidence which he had felt
in this man, since first meeting him, face to face.</p>
<p>An engagement was made for the near future, and with
a cordial hand-clasp, the two men parted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>The next evening, as Houston stood for a few moments
in the little porch, watching a game of lawn tennis which
had been hastily improvised by the merry crowd, Lyle
suddenly left the group of players and joined him. Looking
at him rather archly, she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to remain out as late to-night as you
did last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just how late I may be detained,&rdquo; he
answered, smiling, &ldquo;Why? are you keeping a watchful
eye upon me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Mr. Rutherford used to call
himself your guardian, and now that he is gone, I must
make his place good;&rdquo; then she added more seriously,
&ldquo;This is an altogether different country from what you
have been accustomed to; it is not particularly pleasant
or safe for one to keep late hours here, especially if he has
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston was somewhat surprised by this second warning,
but he answered lightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know I am in what Ned used to call &lsquo;the camp
of the Philistines,&rsquo; but you do not think I have any dangerous
enemies, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only fear of detection that keeps some of them
from being dangerous,&rdquo; said Lyle, who saw Miss Gladden
approaching, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give them any opportunities for
working their spite in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden just then came up, and Lyle soon resumed
her place among the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going out again this evening, Mr. Houston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Gladden,&rdquo; replied Houston with mock
gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Everard,&rdquo; she answered, blushing, &ldquo;but
when so many strangers are about, I am obliged to be
very circumspect, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no strangers within hearing at present, Leslie,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t it nearly time for this crowd
to take its departure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they expect to leave to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston devoutly.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued rather savagely, &ldquo;I hope, after
they are gone, we can enjoy our evenings again as we
used to. For the last ten days, I have scarcely had an
opportunity for a word with you, unless we deliberately
gave the whole company the cold shoulder, which, of
course, would not answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden laughing, &ldquo;you wreak
your revenge upon poor me these last two evenings, by
taking yourself away, where I cannot even have the satisfaction
of seeing you, while I talk to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston smiled; &ldquo;I am obliged to go out this evening,
Leslie, I have an engagement to-night, with Jack, at his
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Jack!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden, &ldquo;then you
have made his acquaintance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can scarcely say that, for I never exchanged a
half dozen words with him before last evening. This interview
to-night is wholly on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, who saw the players beckoning
to her, &ldquo;I am glad you are going to meet him. I
saw him the other day, and had a talk with him regarding
Lyle, and I wanted to tell you about it, but have had no
opportunity. I think you will find him one of the most
perfect gentlemen you ever met,&rdquo; and with a little farewell
wave of the hand, she left him to rejoin the players who
were waiting for her.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Houston found himself in the inner
room of the little cabin, alone with Jack, while at the outside
door, Rex was stationed as guard.</p>
<p>Already the twilight was beginning to gather in the
little room, but even in its soft, shadowy light, Houston
noted the evidences, existing on all sides, of a refined
nature, a nature keenly appreciative of beauty in all its
forms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Jack, seating himself near his guest,
&ldquo;that you will excuse the gathering darkness; I thought
it more prudent not to have a light, as it might attract attention,
I am in the habit of sitting so much in the twilight,
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light is not necessary,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;the twilight
is very pleasant, and the moon will be up presently,
and will afford us all the light we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment or two of silence, while Houston
waited for his companion to broach the subject of the
evening. He was anxious to ascertain how much regarding
himself and his errand there in the camp, Jack really
knew, and more particularly, to learn, if possible, how he
had become possessed of his knowledge.</p>
<p>Jack, on his part, was wondering whether, with their
brief acquaintance, he could give Houston any assurance
that the latter would consider sufficient to warrant taking
himself into full confidence concerning his work and
plans, so that he could render the assistance he desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were doubtless somewhat surprised,&rdquo; he began
very deliberately and slowly, &ldquo;by my request, last evening,
for this interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I will admit that I was surprised,
more especially by the reason which you gave
for your request,&ndash;&ndash;that you understood my position here,
and desired to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it never occur to you that, to a person with any
degree of penetration, any ability at reading a man&rsquo;s character
and habits of life, your position here, as clerk for a
disreputable mining company, would, of itself, seem an
anomaly, and be liable to excite the suspicion that you
had some ulterior object in view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Houston, with a smile, &ldquo;you are supposing
a person with keener perceptions than are possessed
by many in this locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They nearly all possess them to a certain degree, in a
latent, uncultivated form, perhaps, but still there. For
example, what is the true secret of Maverick&rsquo;s hatred
toward you, of Haight&rsquo;s enmity, except that they recognize
by a sort of instinct that you belong to an altogether
different sphere from that in which they move? They
cannot reason it out perhaps, but they feel it;&ndash;&ndash;your language,
your conduct, your manner, the very cut of your
clothes, though but a plain business suit, proclaim to one
who can read, and reason from these things correctly,
and deduct their results therefrom, that you are a man
of the highest culture and refinement, of high moral
character, and of wealth. Consequently, the question
arises, &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, I do not intend to be personal in my remarks,&rdquo;
replied Houston, &ldquo;but in my opinion, only a
person who has himself moved in the highest circles of
life would be able to reason in this manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;they would be better able to
classify you, as it were, and assign you to your true position,
but these others feel keenly that you are not of their
world, but they are generally incapable of drawing any
conclusions from their observations, as very few of them
have the reasoning faculty, and hence, they would not be
likely to question your object or motive in holding this
position. My design, however, in thus calling your attention
to these facts, is simply to show you that you need
not be greatly surprised when I say that from your first
coming here, I have felt that you were no ordinary employe;
that you were merely holding this position temporarily,
either in your own interests, or in the interests of
some one else,&ndash;&ndash;but not in the interests of the mining
company. Notwithstanding the fact that I live a very secluded
life, I yet have means of ascertaining nearly all
that is going on around me, and I will say to you truthfully,
that I learned the secret of your mission here without
even asking a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely understand,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;how you
came to be the recipient of this secret, since you do not
mingle with others, and apparently take very little interest
in their affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Jack, in low, musical tones, &ldquo;you
would be able to understand the situation better, did you
know that your secret was told me by a friend of yours,
who believed that, through my very isolation and loneliness,
I could the better assist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston, in surprise,
&ldquo;Is it possible that my eastern friends are known to you,
and that some one of them has written you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has written me, the story was told me by a
friend of yours here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there flashed into Houston&rsquo;s mind the memory
of Lyle&rsquo;s warning, and also of Miss Gladden&rsquo;s declaration
that she had seen and talked with Jack, but how
could his true position be known to either of them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have but two friends here, at present,&rdquo; was his reply,
&ldquo;and they are women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True women are the truest friends,&rdquo; said Jack tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can either of them know anything regarding
my work here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; and very briefly Jack gave Houston
an account of how his plans had first become known to
Lyle, and of her subsequent interview with himself, begging
his assistance in Houston&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>Houston was inexpressibly astonished and touched to
find that the beautiful girl, whom he had considered
friendless and helpless, and whom he had defended
through a sense of chivalry, had, in return, served him
so nobly and so opportunely. He resolved to see her and
express to her his appreciation of what she had done, as
early as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jack, in conclusion, &ldquo;you will admit
that by this means I have obtained a thorough understanding
of what you wish to accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand it perfectly,&rdquo; Houston answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will also admit that, after the years of experience
that I have had in these particular mines, I must be
thoroughly conversant with affairs in connection therewith,
and could probably render you just the assistance
you will need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly you could,&rdquo; responded Houston quickly,
&ldquo;I know of no one in the entire camp who could assist
us so well as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;the next and only consideration is,
whether you have that degree of confidence in me, that
you would feel warranted in trusting me implicitly,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough said,&rdquo; said Houston, interrupting him hastily
but cordially, &ldquo;I have that confidence in you, that, even if
you had not sought this interview, sooner or later, I
would have come to you for assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, in surprise, &ldquo;may I ask
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston hesitated a moment, and then replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, though we have met so recently, we may
speak together as friends, or as brothers; you spoke a
while ago of the faculty of perception; please credit me
with possessing it in some degree myself, and while I do
not wish to be personal or intrusive in my remarks, I am
sure you will allow me to say, that if there is any degree
of incongruity between my appearance and the position
I hold, it certainly exists in a much greater degree in your
own case. I, of course, know nothing of your past life;
I wish to know nothing of it, except so far as you yourself
would tell me, should you ever choose to do so, but this
much I do know, and have known from the first, that
you are vastly superior to your surroundings here. You
claim,&ndash;&ndash;and you are correct,&ndash;&ndash;that I have had the advantages
of excellent birth and breeding, of culture and
wealth, but you are not one whit behind me in any of
these things. Added to all this is the experience which
you have accumulated in these late years, in this particular
branch of work; surely it was not strange that I felt
your acquaintance would be invaluable, could I but secure
your friendship sufficiently for you to be interested
in my plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon had risen, flooding the little room with a
soft, pale light, but Jack was sitting in the shadow, and
Houston could not see the effect produced by his words.
He wondered a little that Jack made no response, and,
after waiting in silence for a moment or two, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one other consideration which you have not
mentioned, and which must not be omitted, and that is
compensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden movement on Jack&rsquo;s part caused Houston to
pause for an instant, but nothing was said, and he proceeded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not think of asking you to share the difficulties
and dangers of this work without abundant compensation.
Mr. Cameron, my uncle, who is interested&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Jack, putting up one hand as if to ward
off a blow; his voice was hoarse, almost stern, and vibrated
with some strange, deep emotion; &ldquo;If you ever
speak to me again of compensation, I will utterly refuse
to help you in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Houston, in a low, gentle
tone, &ldquo;I intended no offense, and I shall certainly respect
your wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no offense,&rdquo; replied Jack, more calmly,
&ldquo;but you spoke a few moments since of friendship; that
word, to a man living the life I have lived, means volumes;
whatever I do, let it be done for friendship&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So let it be!&rdquo; responded Houston solemnly, strangely
moved by Jack&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>For a long time they talked of the work before them,
and Houston spoke of the expected arrival of Van Dorn
within the next day or two, who was to remain until the
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end is not far distant,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;for after his
coming I can give you nearly all the additional proof
needed,&rdquo; and he then proceeded to give information concerning
matters of which Houston had not, as yet, obtained
even a clue. An arrangement was made whereby
Houston and Van Dorn, after the arrival of the latter,
were to meet Jack at the cabin, and perfect their plans
for the brief campaign before them.</p>
<p>At last, as Houston rose to take his leave, he said: &ldquo;I
hope you will pardon the remark, but while I have not the
least doubt of your friendship toward me in this, I cannot
overcome the impression that you also have some personal
interest in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; replied Jack, gravely, still standing in the
shadow as Houston stepped forth into the moonlight,
&ldquo;but not in the way in which you think.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>The camping party had returned to Silver City, and the
old house among the mountains slowly subsided into its
former quiet. Lyle&rsquo;s time had been so occupied by the
numerous demands made upon her by the departing
guests, that Houston had found no opportunity for speaking
with her, as he had planned the previous evening.</p>
<p>When the day&rsquo;s work was completed, he, with Miss
Gladden and Lyle, sat in the little porch, watching a brief
but furious mountain storm, which had suddenly sprung
up, preventing them from taking their customary evening
stroll.</p>
<p>To the ordinary beauty of the scene around them was
added the grandeur of the tempest, forming a spectacle
not easily forgotten. Around the summits of the lofty
peaks the fierce lightnings were playing, sometimes darting
back and forth like the swords of mighty giants, flashing
in mortal combat; sometimes descending swiftly in
fiery chains, then seeming to wrap the whole universe in
sheets of flame; while the crash and roll of the thunder
echoed and re-echoed from peak to peak, the lingering
reverberations still muttering and rumbling in the distance,
as the fierce cannonading was again renewed. The
wind rushed, roaring and shrieking, down the canyon,
while the rain fell in gusty, fitful torrents.</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour, only a few stray drops were
falling, the sun suddenly burst forth in a flood of golden
light, and against the dark background of the storm-cloud,
a rainbow spanned the eastern horizon, its glorious
tints seeming almost to rival the gorgeous colors of the
western sky.</p>
<p>Soon after the storm had passed, Haight was seen approaching
the house. As he came up, he handed a telegraphic
dispatch to Houston, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got a wire from the boss for you and Morgan;
did you know anything about this kind of an arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston opened the telegram, and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Van Dorn up to-morrow to set up machinery on trial;
may not be able to come myself for a day or two. Have
Morgan and Houston give him all help they can spare,
but not to interfere with work.</p>
<p class='ralign'>Blaisdell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Houston read the message carefully, then said to
Haight, who stood awaiting his reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew nothing of their having made any definite arrangement.
I remember hearing Van Dorn say something
to Mr. Blaisdell, just before they all went away,
about bringing one of his machines out here, but Blaisdell
didn&rsquo;t seem to give him any encouragement at that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He evidently has roped the old man in on it, at last,&rdquo;
said Haight, seating himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; Houston answered indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the machine anyway?&rdquo; Haight inquired. &ldquo;Is
it any good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;because I know
absolutely nothing about it, except that it is for the reduction
of ores. I heard Van Dorn allude to it two or three
times while he was here, and he seemed quite enthusiastic
about it, which I thought was, of course, perfectly
natural. Where is Morgan?&rdquo; Houston continued, &ldquo;have
you told him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haight shook his head; &ldquo;Morgan is at the Y, I suppose,
as usual, and nobody will see him before sometime
to-morrow. Have you noticed that fellow lately, Mr.
Houston? Half the time he don&rsquo;t seem to know what he&rsquo;s
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have noticed that he scarcely appears like himself,
of late,&rdquo; Houston replied; &ldquo;he seems to have some serious
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been losing pretty heavy lately, I guess, that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter; he&rsquo;s awful reckless in his gambling,
it&rsquo;s neck or nothing, with him. I tell you,&rdquo; Haight continued,
watching Houston sharply, &ldquo;Morgan would get the
G.B. pretty sudden if the boss got onto the way he&rsquo;s carrying
sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Houston, quietly, &ldquo;but he will not
know of it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Haight, with a curious, rising reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; responded Houston, with some warmth,
&ldquo;when a man is in trouble, it is no time to give him a push
downward; besides, I would not do or say anything to
injure Morgan, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haight looked up curiously, and even the faces of the
ladies expressed a slight surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you and Morgan were such good
friends,&rdquo; Haight remarked wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;that either he or I
consider that we are particular friends, though we are
friendly enough, but I have learned this about Morgan;
that whatever his principles, or his manner of life may
be, he is far less to be blamed than people would ordinarily
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Haight, rising, &ldquo;Morgan and I have been
together, off and on, for the last three years, but I don&rsquo;t
know anything about him except just what I have seen
for myself, what anybody can see; of course his way isn&rsquo;t
my way, but then, we don&rsquo;t any of us think alike, and
I&rsquo;ve never had any fault to find with him, and we&rsquo;ve got
along together first rate. I suppose,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you
will give directions in the morning for that fellow and his
machines, for it isn&rsquo;t likely that Morgan will be around
much before ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;I will be up early and
will see that one of the six-horse teams is at the Y to meet
him, and I can get through at the mines in season to be
at the office by the time he will reach there; he probably
will not get up before noon, with all that load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happening to glance toward Lyle, as Haight withdrew,
Houston read in her eyes, in their look of eager
expectancy, and the firm determination expressed in her
face, that she fully understood the meaning of what had
passed.</p>
<p>It was equally evident that Miss Gladden had received
no hint of the situation, for at almost the same instant she
inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Van Dorn going to erect one of his reducing
machines here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be likely to remain here some time, then, will
he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all probability,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;it must take
considerable time to get one of those machines in perfect
running order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course he will be here when Mr. Rutherford
returns, with his brother; they were all such intimate
friends, it will be pleasant for them to meet here. But I
am surprised,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that he is bringing one of
his machines such a distance as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Mr. Winters told me that although the
amalgamator was undoubtedly a valuable invention, and
would prove a great success in a mining country, Van
Dorn was too indolent to even try to introduce it among
mining men, as it would require too much exertion on
his part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston smiled at this accurate description of his class
mate.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden continued: &ldquo;Mr. Winters said that Van
Dorn was a fine fellow, but that he was never so happy as
when engaged in some little scheme, apparently doing
one thing, and in reality, doing something else, as when
he was acting as mining expert for Mr. Winters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Houston, laughing, &ldquo;if that is the characteristic
of Mr. Van Dorn, it will not be best to mention it
here, as the officers of the company are very suspicious
anyway, and very guarded as to who is permitted to have
access to the mines and mills, and we might unconsciously
make it rather unpleasant for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, Houston went very early to the stables
to order a team and three or four men to the Y to
meet Van Dorn. Having given all necessary instructions,
he returned to the house, but it was still early, and there
was no one but Lyle in the breakfast room.</p>
<p>At a signal from Houston, she approached the door-way,
where he remained standing, as from that position
he could easily watch both the porch and the interior of
the room, to assure himself that they were safe from
listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just discovered recently,&rdquo; he began in a low
tone, &ldquo;that I am indebted to you for securing valuable assistance
for me in my work here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked quickly, in surprise, &ldquo;did Jack tell
you that it was I who asked him to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;I naturally wished to
know where he obtained his information, and he told me
of your interview with him, and your persistent efforts
in my behalf. I want to thank you, for I appreciate your
conduct under such circumstances; you acted wisely and
nobly, and did the very best thing that could have been
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that I have your approval,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;my
overhearing what I did was unintentional and unavoidable,
but having learned your plans, and that you needed
help, I sought it from the only one competent to give it,
and at the same time perfectly true and worthy of your
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly made a noble use of the knowledge you
had obtained; there are very few, Lyle, who could have
been trusted with such a secret, and who would have
proven so trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will pardon me for saying it, Mr. Houston,
there is one other, whom you could, and, in my opinion,
should trust with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston looked at her inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Miss Gladden,&rdquo; was her response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have given her no hint,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;it was not my place to
do so; you know best what you wish her to know, and
when, but I think you ought to confide in her fully, for
she is a noble woman; you could trust her, and she would
help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize that,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;but I did not wish
her to be worried by this; there will probably be more or
less danger before it is all over, and I thought she would
be happier not to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle lifted her beautiful head proudly, with a gesture so
full of grace, Houston could not but observe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were in her place,&rdquo; she said, slowly and firmly, and
with peculiar emphasis, &ldquo;and my lover were in any danger,
I would far rather know it, and give him my help,
if possible, my prayers and sympathy at any rate, than to
remain in ignorance, and perhaps unconsciously hinder
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston looked at Lyle in astonishment; was this
clear-headed woman the untutored, untrained child of the
mountains whom he had always regarded with a tender,
chivalric regard, almost akin to pity?</p>
<p>Lyle continued; &ldquo;Do not think that even if you refrain
from telling her this secret, she will not know that it exists;
she will be quick to see indications of a secret understanding
between yourself and others,&ndash;&ndash;between yourself
and myself, even,&ndash;&ndash;in which she has no share. Will
that seem to her like confidence, or even justice, on your
part. It will be better for her, for you and for me that
you tell her your plans fully, for you will find her strong
and true and brave, whatever the end shall prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lyle,&rdquo; said Houston, slowly, &ldquo;I believe you
are right, and I will never consider you a child again; but
I cannot understand how you, with your youth and inexperience,
can think and act so wisely and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We none of us know what we can do or be,&rdquo; she
answered gravely, &ldquo;till an emergency arises, and we are
suddenly shown what is required of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will follow your suggestion at the first opportunity,&rdquo;
Houston said, after a pause, &ldquo;I shall tell Miss Gladden all
that you know regarding my plans and my work, with
but one reservation; for the present, I do not wish her to
know that Mr. Cameron is related to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle looked slightly surprised, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered,
in a tone of assent, adding, &ldquo;You are his nephew,
are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His nephew and his adopted son,&rdquo; Houston replied,
with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she replied quietly, &ldquo;I understand; Miss Gladden
is to know nothing at present of your wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have won her love with love, not with gold,&rdquo; he
said proudly, &ldquo;but she will find, by and by, that the latter
is not lacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A remark of Miss Gladden&rsquo;s, which she had made in
confidence, soon after her engagement to Houston, was
suddenly recalled to Lyle&rsquo;s mind; &ldquo;Whether he has
money or not, I do not know or care, for I have enough
for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious smile flitted over her face for a moment, but
she only said, &ldquo;You must be very wealthy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have enough,&rdquo; Houston responded, &ldquo;to give to Miss
Gladden the home of which she is worthy, but which she
has never known; and,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there is one thing,
my dear Lyle, upon which we are both agreed; that our
home, wherever it shall be, shall be your home also, as
our sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, Lyle&rsquo;s lips quivered, and she was unable
to speak. At that instant, Haight entered the breakfast
room, darting at them a look of curiosity and suspicion,
as they stood together in the door-way. Houston
was pleased to see Lyle&rsquo;s perfect self-control. Without
stirring in the least from her place by his side, she asked,
in the most matter-of-fact tone, whether Mr. Van Dorn
would be likely to arrive from the Y in season for dinner,
and what room it would be best to prepare for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better let him share my room, in case he has
no objections,&rdquo; Houston answered indifferently, &ldquo;for
you like to keep your rooms in readiness for guests as
much as possible, and Rutherford, when he returns, will
probably room with his brother.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Houston was hurrying up from the mines at about
eleven o&rsquo;clock, on his way to the office, he met Morgan,
just started on his rounds, and was shocked at the change
which a few hours had made in his appearance. His
heavy gait, his pale, haggard face and bloodshot eyes,
told, not only of late hours and terrible dissipation, but of
some severe mental strain, also. Morgan half smiled, as
he saw Houston&rsquo;s look of pained surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know I look pretty hard this morning,
but I was up late; I guess I&rsquo;ll be all right in a day or
two. What&rsquo;s this Haight&rsquo;s been telling me about one
of those fellows coming out here with some mining machinery?
Which one is it, that English dude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Houston, &ldquo;Van Dorn, the one with
glasses, he was the inventor, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he&rsquo;s invented anything that will make old
Rivers hand out any cash, he&rsquo;d better get a patent on it,
that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say. How in thunder the old man
ever gave his consent to his coming out here, monkey-fooling
around with his machines, is more&rsquo;n I can make
out; but if the company want him up here, I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t care a damn. The boss himself isn&rsquo;t coming up, is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a day or two,&rdquo; replied Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan, with one of his characteristic
shrugs, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to spruce up a bit, before he
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, Morgan,&rdquo; said Houston, kindly, &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t want Mr. Blaisdell to see you as you look this
morning; I&rsquo;m too much a friend of yours myself for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;ll be all right before he gets here. Who&rsquo;s
going down to meet that fellow and his contraptions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent Hayes down with two or three men, and a six-horse
team, early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; laughed Morgan, starting on his way,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make a first-rate boss &rsquo;round here; guess I&rsquo;ll
have to give you a raise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston walked slowly down the road after Morgan
left him, having apparently forgotten his haste. The
story which Morgan had told him a few nights before, of
his own life, had awakened his pity for the man as nothing
else could have done. He felt that Morgan was in
serious trouble, and in danger of losing his position, and
that he was already where it would take very little to drive
him to complete ruin. He resolved to seize the first opportunity
that presented itself, to try to ascertain the
cause of his trouble, and to assist him in any way that he
possibly could.</p>
<p>On reaching the office, he found considerable work
awaiting him, and for a while, all other thoughts were
banished from his mind. About noon, a heavy rumbling
and rattling attracted his attention, and, going to the
door, he saw the slowly approaching team, winding from
side to side of the steep, canyon road, the powerful horses
straining and panting under the heavy load. Perched on
the top of the load, under a wide-spread umbrella, and
fanning himself with his straw hat, was Van Dorn, his
face irradiated by a broad smile as he caught sight of
Houston. Two of the men walked beside the team,
blocking the wheels with rocks, as the horses were occasionally
stopped to rest. As they came within speaking
distance, Van Dorn sang out merrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Houston, this is what I call up-hill work; it has
been a pretty hard pull all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;particularly hard on you, judging
by appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn laughed, and proceeded to close his umbrella,
while an expansive grin broke over the face of
one of the workmen, trudging along the hot, dusty road.
At the brow of the hill, the team again stopped to rest,
and Van Dorn descended from his lofty position, Houston
meanwhile giving instructions to the driver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive over to the stables, Hayes, and take the horses
off and let them rest; after dinner, put on another set of
horses, and drive to the mills; we will be there to see to
the unloading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Everard, old boy, how are you?&rdquo; exclaimed Van
Dorn, as they started for the office; &ldquo;I started within five
hours after I received your telegram, and here I am, at
your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you reach Silver City? yesterday?&rdquo; inquired
Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday!&rdquo; exclaimed Van Dorn, &ldquo;my dear boy, do
you think the world was made in one day? No, sir; I
got in the day before, and spent the remainder of that
day, and all of yesterday in cultivating the good graces of
your company. I went straight for their offices, and it
took all the arguments and persuasion I could muster,
with some treating, and a good deal of judicious flattery
thrown in, before I could get the old fellows to consent
to my giving the machine a trial. I got around Blaisdell
pretty easy after I had flattered him a little, but that
Rivers is a beast! Said he didn&rsquo;t see why I was so anxious
to have them test the machine, and all that! I explained,
of course, that this was the first I had ever
brought it out into the west, and they were so well known
that if I could only get their endorsement, and so on and
so forth. Oh, I want to tell you all about it later, and if
you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that I&rsquo;m a born diplomat, I&rsquo;ll give
up; but at present, my first business must be to allay
these pangs of hunger, they are becoming unendurable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, we will go to the house at once,&rdquo; said Houston,
preparing to close the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said Van Dorn, diving furiously into
his pockets; &ldquo;I attended to that little business that you
wrote me about, just according to directions, and I want
you to see if it is perfectly satisfactory before we go any
further, and then I&rsquo;ll have it off my mind; why, confound
it! where is that thing anyway?&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning
a half dozen pockets inside out, and emptying a heterogeneous
collection upon the desk before him. &ldquo;Oh, here
it is! I knew I had it safe somewhere; there now, Everard,
I took as much pains as if it had been for myself, it
was one of the finest stones I could find; I think it is a
beauty, and I hope you will like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed a small case to Houston, partially open,
from whose depths of white velvet a superb diamond ring
flashed forth its wondrous rays, seeming almost to
brighten the dingy little room in which they were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a beauty,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;perfect! I
could not have made a better selection myself. I knew I
could trust to your good judgment, Arthur, and I am exceedingly
obliged; I&rsquo;ll do as much for you when you
are ready for a ring of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m glad if you like it. I believe I sent my
congratulations by letter, but I&rsquo;ll renew them now. I
only hope the lady herself will be pleased with the selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their way to the house, Van Dorn said: &ldquo;Ned
Rutherford has gone to the coast to meet his brother, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you probably know he and Morton are intending
to stop here on their return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mort, as soon as he found you were here, and
especially after I gave him an inkling of what was going
on, said he should certainly stop as he came back. You
ought to have seen him though, when I told him you
were out here! Good gracious! he was simply thunderstruck!
He said Ned had been writing all along about
a Houston, from Chicago, that he had met on the
train, and that he was a fine fellow, and all that; but of
course he never dreamed it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of the day passed very swiftly, for there
was much to be done. After dinner, Houston and Van
Dorn went down to the mills and superintended the unloading
and unpacking of the machinery; then, as it was
too late in the day to begin preparations for its erection,
Houston visited the mines, Van Dorn accompanying him
only a little way into the main shaft. As they came out
together, half an hour later, and started for the office,
Van Dorn drew a small piece of ore from his pocket, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered now where that fine ore on the dump
of the famous Sunrise lode came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;and you will make other discoveries,
shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the office there was much to be said on both sides;
Van Dorn giving his friend messages and directions from
Mr. Cameron, and giving also the particulars of his interview
with the company, and how he had finally obtained
their consent for the erection of the machinery at
their mills.</p>
<p>Houston, on his part, related what he had been doing
in the few weeks intervening since Van Dorn&rsquo;s former
visit, and explained his new position as assistant superintendent
of the group of mines in which they were most
interested.</p>
<p>Van Dorn whistled; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
wondered how it was that you were going in and out
among the mines in that way, I thought that was something
new. Have you found any one whom we can trust
to help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reply, Houston told his friend of Jack, of his experience
and skill as a miner, and of his offer to help
them.</p>
<p>Van Dorn was greatly interested, and before they were
aware, the afternoon had passed, and it was time to close
the office and return to the house.</p>
<p>At the supper table that evening, the diamond ring appeared,
flashing on the white, shapely hand of Leslie
Gladden, and she herself looked radiantly beautiful.</p>
<p>After the meal was over, Morgan, who was still pale
and haggard, and had been very silent at the table, pulled
his hat down over his eyes, and started down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan,&rdquo; called Houston, &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dun&rsquo;no,&rdquo; he answered moodily, &ldquo;down to the Y, I
guess, by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hold on a minute, I will walk down with you a
ways; I want to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Morgan, walking on very
slowly.</p>
<p>Houston hastily excused himself to Miss Gladden and
Van Dorn, and hurrying after Morgan, soon overtook
him. For some time, Houston talked with him regarding
the work for the next day, and the men who could
best be detailed to help Van Dorn. They had reached
the same spot where they had stopped to talk a few nights
before, and, as then, were seated on the rocks. At last,
the business arrangements were all completed, and Morgan
made a move as if to start, and then Houston&rsquo;s real
errand in overtaking him became apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan, you are not fit to be out to-night, you must
have rest, you will break down living this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morgan, raising his hollow, heavy eyes to
Houston&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about done up, that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go to the Y to-night, if I were you; come
back to the house and get a good night&rsquo;s rest, it will make
a different man of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan looked undecided for a moment; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t
be no use going up there now,&rdquo; he answered gloomily,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rest if I tried. I haven&rsquo;t slept scarcely any
for three nights; but I ain&rsquo;t going to stay out late to-night
as I&rsquo;ve been doing; I shan&rsquo;t play after midnight.
I&rsquo;m going to have two or three games just to see what
luck I&rsquo;ll have, and if I don&rsquo;t have luck, why, that ends
it, I ain&rsquo;t going to play all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan,&rdquo; said Houston earnestly, &ldquo;you spoke the
other night about money; now, as I told you then, if
you need any money, I&rsquo;m your friend, and I&rsquo;ll gladly accommodate
you with whatever you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time in all their acquaintance, Morgan&rsquo;s
careless, indifferent manner changed, and for a few moments
he seemed touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;re more of a friend to me than anybody else. Blaisdell
would kick me out quicker&rsquo;n it takes to say so, if he
knew just how I stand to-night. Even Haight&rsquo;s got the
big-head and puts on his airs since he&rsquo;s seen I&rsquo;m down;
you&rsquo;re the only one that&rsquo;s showed me any kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Morgan, just say what money you need, and
you shall have it; I want to help you out of this,&rdquo; said
Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morgan, decidedly, &ldquo;if I am a gambler, and
all that, I ain&rsquo;t going to take the wages from a fellow that
works for less than I do, to help me out of trouble. The
Lord knows you&rsquo;ve earnt your money, for you&rsquo;ve worked
faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that, Morgan,&rdquo; said Houston, hastily,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wholly dependent on my salary; I had a
good little sum of money laid by before I came out here;
there is plenty, I will not miss it, and you are welcome
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you, Houston, but I can&rsquo;t take it,&ndash;&ndash;not
now, at any rate,&ndash;&ndash;maybe I&rsquo;ll call on you for it to-morrow,
if I don&rsquo;t have luck to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to it whenever you want it,&rdquo; said
Houston cordially, his hand on Morgan&rsquo;s shoulder; &ldquo;I
only wish you were not going to the Y to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morgan, as he rose slowly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think
I don&rsquo;t appreciate your kindness, for I do. You&rsquo;ve heard
me say that I didn&rsquo;t believe in honor in anybody; I guess
I&rsquo;ll have to take that back, for if there is such a thing as
honor, you&rsquo;ve got it. I don&rsquo;t know how it is,&rdquo; he said,
with a heavy sigh, then added slowly, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve
been raised different somehow, from most of us out here.
The Lord knows how I was raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started a few steps down the road, hesitated, and
came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houston, there&rsquo;s one thing I want to say to you, for
you&rsquo;ve been good to me, that&rsquo;s this; look out for Haight;
he&rsquo;s no friend of yours, and I guess you&rsquo;re sharp enough
to know it, but maybe you don&rsquo;t know what a sneaking,
cowardly cur he is; look out for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Morgan, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t like anybody
I let &rsquo;em know it, and fight &rsquo;em fair and square; you
can tell that by the way I bucked up against you, when
you first came here,&rdquo; and he smiled at the recollection,
the first time he had smiled in the whole conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sorry for that a
good many times since; if I had known about you then
what you have since told me, I never would have been
so severe in my judgment of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was all right,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it did me good;
I didn&rsquo;t like you very well at first, but I&rsquo;ve always had a
liking for you ever since. Well, so long!&rdquo; and with a
faint smile, Morgan went on his way.</p>
<p>Houston stood watching him for a few moments, then
turned back in the direction of the house, little thinking
how, or where, they would meet again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning dawned fair and cloudless, giving
promise of one of those royal days, so frequent in the
almost perfect climate of the higher altitudes.</p>
<p>Long before noon the heat would be intense, but in
the early morning there was wafted down from the mountain
side, where the pines were nodding and whispering
so mysteriously, a cool, exhilarating breeze, which kissed
the surface of the azure lake, sleeping so peacefully, and,
awakening immediately into smiles, it lay rippling and
dimpling with laughter in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The vines, transplanted by Miss Gladden and Lyle, under
their fostering care, had transformed the little porch
into a bower of beauty. Here stood Van Dorn, his fair,
almost feminine face flushed with pleasure, and his blue
eyes sparkling, as the light breeze played with the auburn
curls clustering about his forehead, and he looked forth
on the beauty of the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;h!&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
this refreshing after the stifling heat and dust of the journey
out here? Isn&rsquo;t it glorious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; responded Houston, &ldquo;this is one of the mornings
when it is a joy just simply to live and breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston was fired with new ambition that morning;
he would no longer have to work alone, keeping his anxieties
and doubts, his plans and discoveries alike to himself;
from henceforth he would have companionship,
counsel and assistance, and he felt a new interest and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Immediately after breakfast, the two set forth upon
their first day&rsquo;s work. Going first to the mills, Houston
secured the services of two or three men who could be
spared from the ordinary work, to assist Van Dorn in
making preparations for the erection of the machinery;
then he left for his early visit to the mines.</p>
<p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when, having finished his
round of duties at the mines, and coming up to the surface
from the cool, underground workings, he found the
heat almost unendurable, and strolled over to the mills,
to see how Van Dorn was progressing. The latter did
not seem averse to stopping for a few moments, and for
a while, the two chatted and laughed with the old, careless
abandon of their college days, without a thought of
the more serious side of life, until, something being
needed for the work, which Houston thought was in the
tool-house, they proceeded together to look for it.</p>
<p>Houston was still searching for the needed implements,
when Van Dorn, who was near the door, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Everard, here&rsquo;s a small specimen of humanity
who seems to be looking for you in a desperate hurry,&rdquo;
and an instant later, he heard a familiar voice say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the boss in there, mister? Le&rsquo;me in quick, I wan&rsquo;ter
see &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning quickly, he saw Bull-dog, breathless, pale and
quivering with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boss,&rdquo; he gasped, before Houston could speak,
&ldquo;they want yer&ndash;&ndash;down ter the Y,&ndash;&ndash;Morgan has shot hisself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, boy?&rdquo; exclaimed Houston hoarsely,
clearing the space between them at a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan&rsquo;s shot hisself, &rsquo;n they sent us fer yer,&ndash;&ndash;me&rsquo;n
Hank,&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s out there,&rdquo; with a backward jerk of his
thumb over his shoulder toward the open door.</p>
<p>Houston sprang to the door; another boy was talking
excitedly with Van Dorn, while his horse stood, panting
heavily and covered with dust and foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the man you want,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, turning
a white face toward Houston, &ldquo;Great God, Everard!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Morgan has killed himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not dead!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston, turning towards
the boy.</p>
<p>The latter nodded; &ldquo;They found &rsquo;im shot through the
head, &rsquo;n this was in his hand, &rsquo;n the cops won&rsquo;t let nobody
in till you come,&rdquo; and he handed Houston a bit of paper.</p>
<p>It was a scrap of newspaper, crumpled and spattered
with blood, and, as Houston smoothed it out, he read on
the margin, in characters wavering and almost illegible,
written with a trembling hand, but still Morgan&rsquo;s writing,
&ldquo;Send to the camp for Houston, he&rsquo;s the only friend
I&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant, it seemed to Houston as though the
glorious sunlight had suddenly turned to blackness, a
blackness in which the scrap of paper gleamed white before
him, its red spots glowing like spots of flame. He
seemed again to see Morgan as he looked when parting
from him the previous evening; the haggard face, with
its hollow eyes and faint, pathetic smile, and as he recalled
his words in reply to his own repeated offers of money,
there seemed a new meaning in them; &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll call on
you for it to-morrow if I don&rsquo;t have luck to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Houston realized there was no time to waste, and
in a few moments he was mounted on a powerful gray
horse, on his way to the Y, notwithstanding Van Dorn&rsquo;s
protests on account of the intense heat, having requested
the latter to explain his absence at the house. Just as
he was about to start, Bull-dog begged to be allowed to
ride with him, to which Houston consented, and lifting
the little fellow up, seated him in front of himself. Very
little was said, for the horse seemed to understand what
was expected of him, and sped like the wind down the
narrow canyon road, but Houston&rsquo;s hand rested kindly
on Bull-dog&rsquo;s shoulder, steadying the slender frame, and,
at the same time, warming the heart of the forlorn little
waif, to whom even the touch of kindness was something
exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s mind was occupied with thoughts of the
terrible scene he was rapidly approaching, as well as with
memories of his last interview with Morgan on the preceding
night. At last, having crossed a ravine, the horse
slackened his pace, as he climbed the steep ascent on the
other side, and Houston, almost unconsciously, spoke his
thoughts aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Morgan!&rdquo; he said, with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;poor
fellow! If I could only have saved him from this! God
knows I would have given him any amount of money to
have prevented this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been no use, sir,&rdquo; Bull-dog broke in
quickly, eager to console Houston, &ldquo;&rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been
no use to have give &rsquo;im money, &rsquo;cause, ye see, them fellers
that he played with would ha&rsquo; got it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was Faro Dick and Slicky Sam, and a lot
of &rsquo;em; Morgan wasn&rsquo;t no match for fellers like them,
they was all too swift fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I seen &rsquo;em playin&rsquo; lots o&rsquo; times, and they&rsquo;re all
reg&rsquo;lar sharpers, &rsquo;n Morgan, he&rsquo;d got reckless, &rsquo;n he didn&rsquo;t
stan&rsquo; no show against &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston looked down wonderingly and pityingly upon
the little fellow, young in years, but who knew so much of
the dark side of life, but nothing more was said, as, having
reached the top of the hill, the station was close at
hand.</p>
<p>Having left his horse in charge of one of the company&rsquo;s
men, Houston, accompanied by Bull-dog as guide, proceeded
across the street, to the group of dirty, disreputable-looking
buildings containing the saloons, gambling
houses and dance halls. He had little need of a guide,
for, before the shabbiest and most disreputable of the entire
lot, was gathered a motley crowd, gazing with awestruck
curiosity at the building in which had been enacted
the tragedy of the night before. It was a saloon
with gambling rooms in the rear. Here Morgan had
played his last game,&ndash;&ndash;just to see what luck he would
have,&ndash;&ndash;as he had said to Houston, and from which he had
come forth ruined, despairing, desperate.</p>
<p>Passing through the crowd of jabbering Chinamen and
&ldquo;dagoes,&rdquo; of miners off shift, drawn hither by curiosity,
and of gamblers of all grades from the professional expert
to the &ldquo;tin-horn,&rdquo; Houston found his way around
the corner of the building, down into an alley, dark, dismal
and reeking with filth. Here were groups of slatternly,
unkempt women, some of whom stared at him
with brazen faces, while others slunk away, not quite lost
to shame.</p>
<p>At last they came to a rickety stair-way, and as they
neared the top, Bull-dog whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of &rsquo;em now; that tall feller is Faro Dick,
he deals down stairs, and the little, black feller is Slicky,
and that short, fat one, that&rsquo;s Brocky Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group gathered about the door-way at the head of
the stairs eyed Houston curiously as he approached. He
gave them only a quick, keen glance, but in that glance
he had detected the trio named by Bull-dog, and they
cowered visibly beneath the scorn and contempt which
flashed from his eye, while the entire group of loungers
made way, impelled partly by an unconscious respect for
the broad, powerful shoulders, and splendid, athletic
frame.</p>
<p>Down a dark, narrow hall, Bull-dog led the way to a
door guarded by two men, who touched their caps respectfully
to Houston. They were two of the mining
company&rsquo;s watchmen, who were kept at the station to
guard their property, and to preserve order generally,
and hence were designated by the gamins of the place as
police and &ldquo;cops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently they unlocked and opened the door for Houston,
and one of them entered with him. It was a small
room, evidently a woman&rsquo;s, and its general squalor and
dilapidation were made more apparent by tawdry, shabby
bits of finery strewn here and there. Curtains of red
damask, faded and ragged, hung at the window, excluding
the daylight, and on a small table a kerosene lamp had
burned itself out. But Houston took little notice of the
room; as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light,
he saw but one object.</p>
<p>Across the bed in one corner of the room, lay Morgan,
his left arm thrown out across the pillows, the other
dropped at his side, and a revolver clenched in his right
hand. His head was turned slightly to one side, exposing
the ghastly wound near the temple, his face was blackened
and mutilated, but still bore traces of the terrible strain
of those last few hours of life.</p>
<p>Houston stepped back, even his firm nerves quivering,
and his heart throbbing with a great sorrow for the life
so suddenly quenched in the darkness of despair.</p>
<p>On a chair were Morgan&rsquo;s hat and coat, where he had
thrown them, and as Houston turned toward the little
table, he saw there a newspaper from which a scrap had
been torn. Taking the bit of paper, containing Morgan&rsquo;s
last message, from his pocket, he compared them; it
fitted exactly, and beside the paper lay a bit of pencil with
which those last words had been written, and to Houston,
with his keen perception and vivid imagination, the whole
scene of the previous night with its minute and pathetic
details, seemed passing before his vision. He turned to
the watchman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the window,&rdquo; he said, and his voice sounded
strange even to himself, &ldquo;draw back those curtains, this
place is stifling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, Houston found the watchman could
give him very little information. In passing down the
alley at about eight o&rsquo;clock that morning, his attention
had been arrested by screams issuing from the building.
On rushing up-stairs, he saw a crowd gathering about the
door of this room, and, on entering, was shocked at the
sight revealed. Mollie, the girl who usually occupied the
room, was screaming hysterically, but when able to talk
explained that she had been out all night and had but just
returned. Morgan was in the habit of coming to the
room, and had a key, but he had not been there of late,
having gambled every night till daylight.</p>
<p>Her screams had attracted nearly the whole neighborhood,
some of whom corroborated her statements, and
one or two testified to having heard a shot sometime
about midnight, but nothing had been thought of it, as
it was supposed to be some row in the gambling rooms
below. The watchman had ordered the crowd out of
the room, and sent the messenger for Houston, and also
a telegram to Silver City for the coroner, who was expected
on the noon train.</p>
<p>As it was nearly noon, Houston decided to step over to
the depot, leaving the room in charge of the watchman.
On his way, he heard various comments from groups
gathered here and there. Passing a half-dozen miners,
he heard one of them say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a been a union man, we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a taken care of &rsquo;im,
but he worked for the bosses, and helped &rsquo;em to make big
money, and now, let the bosses take care of &rsquo;im and bury
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bitter smile crossed Houston&rsquo;s face, and stepping
into the little telegraph office, he sent a message, first, in
his own name, to one of the undertaking firms of Silver
City, for everything that was needed to be sent up by the
special freight that afternoon; and then a brief dispatch
to Mr. Blaisdell, stating what had occurred, but that the
affairs of the company were all right, and there was no
necessity for his coming to the camp immediately.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the train arrived, bringing the
coroner, and as quickly as possible the inquest was held.
Very few facts were developed beyond those already
learned by Houston, excepting the extent of Morgan&rsquo;s
losses. These included not only everything which he had
possessed, even to his watch and a few pieces of jewelry,
but in addition, a large sum of money advanced him by
Brocky Joe. Those with whom he was playing testified
that he had quit shortly before midnight, and left the hall
rather hastily. At the time, they thought he had gone
to borrow more money, and perhaps try his luck at some
other place, but nothing more was seen of him, and they
soon forgot the occurrence.</p>
<p>When all was over and the crowd was slowly dispersing,
Houston saw several members of the gambling fraternity
approaching him, headed by the two designated
by Bull-dog as Slicky Sam and Brocky Joe. The latter,
a stout, red-faced individual, with flaming necktie and
blazing diamonds, was evidently speaker for the entire
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like,&rdquo; he began, in a high-pitched, falsetto
voice, &ldquo;to express our regrets for what has occurred, and
I wish to state on behalf of my associates here, and also
personally, that there was no ill feeling toward your
friend, and I am perfectly willing to overlook the small
amount of indebtedness; and if there is anything we can
do, in the way of sharing the burial expenses, or anything
of the kind, we shall be glad to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your assistance is not needed,&rdquo; replied Houston, in
a cold, cutting tone, &ldquo;you have already done your work;
you and your ilk have brought him where he is, and that
is enough,&rdquo; and he turned abruptly from them.</p>
<p>As he re-entered the room, he met Mollie, who cast an
appealing glance at him. She could not have been over
twenty years of age, but she looked worn and haggard.
Her hair was disheveled, large, dark rings encircled her
heavy, lusterless eyes, now swollen with weeping, and
there was a look of helpless and hopeless despair in her
glance that aroused Houston&rsquo;s pity. It was a new experience
for him to be brought into contact with these
wrecked and ruined lives, and sorrow for the one life
which had gone out so suddenly and needlessly, made
him pitiful toward all.</p>
<p>A look of pity, a word of pure, disinterested kindness,
was something new in the life of the poor creature before
him, and she began sobbing afresh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want to live no
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you care so much for him?&rdquo; asked Houston, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I never cared for nobody but him.
I thought once he cared for me, but after a while I found
he didn&rsquo;t, and then I went to the bad as fast as I could,
but still I cared for him. I never was very good, for I
never had no chance to be, but I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a been different from
what I am, if he&rsquo;d only &rsquo;a cared for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston went back into the wretched room, and
looked long and sadly at the one who, in his last moments
of despair, had called him his friend. He recalled the
story told him that night among the rocks; he thought
of the life ruined by a mother&rsquo;s neglect and sin, and now
of another life shut out in hopeless misery because of his
indifference and neglect, and Houston realized at that
moment, as never before, the influences, for good or for
evil, extending from one human life to another, spreading
onward and onward,</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;As wave follows wave across the sea,&rdquo;</p>
<p>till the widening circles at last touch the shores of eternity.</p>
<p>An hour or two later, when Houston stepped over to
the depot to meet the incoming special freight, he was
somewhat surprised to see Mr. Blaisdell step from the
train, and in his white face, his firmly set mouth with its
hard lines, and his pale blue eyes, it could readily be seen
that he knew nothing of pity or mercy for the man who
had served him so faithfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not expect you so early, Mr. Blaisdell,&rdquo; said
Houston, as they exchanged greetings, &ldquo;I thought after
receiving my dispatch you would feel no anxiety, and
would probably not come out till the evening train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your telegram was a great relief,&rdquo; Mr. Blaisdell answered
in an excited tone, &ldquo;but I was all ready to come,
as, from the tenor of Haight&rsquo;s message this morning, I
feared the worst. You are sure the affairs of the company
are all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure,&rdquo; replied Houston, calmly, &ldquo;so far as
money is concerned, poor Morgan has wronged no one
but himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;I am
glad to hear that, but this is an outrageous affair,&ndash;&ndash;simply
outrageous,&ndash;&ndash;a man in his responsible position, trusted as
he has been, coming to such an end as this, under such
circumstances and amid such surroundings! It is a disgrace
to himself, and to those associated with him in business,&ndash;&ndash;to
the entire company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought flashed through Houston&rsquo;s mind that a
deeper disgrace than this awaited the company, but he
only replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not looked at it in that light, Mr. Blaisdell; I, as
one of his associates, certainly feel no disgrace attached
to myself. I had thought only of the terrible pity for a
life so needlessly ruined and lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity!&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, contemptuously, &ldquo;If a man
willfully degrades himself and disgraces his friends, I
have no pity for him, he deserves none for such dishonorable,
dishonest conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His dishonesty, as you term it, must have been of
rather an unusual type,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;since I offered
him money only last night, and he refused to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you knew of his habits and offered him money?
It was your duty to have reported him to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need you, Mr. Blaisdell, or any one else, to
tell me what my duty is here,&rdquo; replied Houston, with
dignity, &ldquo;I did not know until recently to what extent
Morgan was gambling, and when a man is in trouble, I
will never give him a push downward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the workmen just then came to Houston for
instructions regarding the shipment which he had ordered
from Silver City, thus attracting Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s attention
in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this, Houston?&rdquo; he exclaimed angrily, &ldquo;what
does this mean? You certainly had no right, no authority
to order these things; the company will not pay one
cent toward the burial of a man who has proven himself
so unworthy of the confidence reposed in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Houston, calmly, but in a tone
his employer had never heard before, &ldquo;there is not the
least necessity for the company to pay one cent, or for
you to feel any concern in this matter. I have ordered
these things myself, personally, upon my own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Mr. Blaisdell had found an employe
who evidently did not stand in fear of him, and surprise
held him silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered, in an altered tone, &ldquo;but I
must say I can see no reason for such a quixotic proceeding
on your part; I never supposed you and Morgan
were particular friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my reason,&rdquo; Houston replied, handing him
the bit of paper bearing Morgan&rsquo;s last words; &ldquo;When a
despairing man, in his last moments, appeals to me as his
friend, and his only friend, even though that man were my
worst enemy, I would feel in duty bound to do for him
everything that a friend could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blaisdell returned the slip, and there was a new respect
indicated in tone and manner, as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you are right, do as you think best.
I am going up to the camp, you can come whenever you
are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be there in a few hours,&rdquo; said Houston, and
they separated.</p>
<p>A little later, everything that he could do had been
done, and as Houston looked for the last time upon the
pale face, where the angel of death was already smoothing
out the lines traced by the last few days of suffering, and
softening the features into a look of contentment and
peace, he was glad that in the last moments of that life,
there had come faith, even in one human being.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, a little group was gathered in
a beautiful, secluded spot, on the mountain side, overlooking
the station. Houston and Van Dorn were there,
and a clergyman from a little parish in a small town a few
miles distant, to whom the sad story had been told, read
the simple but impressive words of the burial service and
offered a brief prayer. And, as the weary body was lowered
to its final resting place, at the foot of the murmuring
pines, there came to the minds of Houston and Van
Dorn the memory of the burial of a class-mate in the old
college days, and simultaneously their voices rose on the
clear, morning air, blending in the words chanted on that
former occasion:&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;Rest, brother, rest in thy last, long sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the little company dispersed, each going his
own way. Upon Houston&rsquo;s mind the events of those last
twenty-four hours had left an impression never to be effaced,
but to most in that community one human life,
more or less, was of slight significance. To them, life
was but one great game, in which fortune, reputation,
character, everything which they possessed, whether
much or little, was staked on the high card. No wonder
that little thought was given to the losers, dropping out,
one by one!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>
<p>The following days were crowded with work for Houston.
A bookkeeper was immediately sent over from Silver
City to do the office work, but, excepting Houston,
the company had no man, both competent and who could
be trusted, to fill Morgan&rsquo;s position. It was therefore arranged
that for the next few weeks, until they could ascertain
the address of a former superintendent, who had
recently returned east, and communicate with him, Houston
was to superintend the working of all the mines.</p>
<p>This involved much additional work and responsibility,
but Houston filled the position so satisfactorily and
showed such business tact and executive ability, that Mr.
Blaisdell, on his return to Silver City, had fully determined
to retain him permanently as superintendent at
the mines, and, if possible, secure Barden, their former
man, as an assistant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Rivers, that Houston is a capable man,
wonderfully capable,&rdquo; he said, having related to the remaining
officers of the company Houston&rsquo;s success in
filling Morgan&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Mr. Brunnell, the
benevolent looking old gentleman whom Houston had
seen on his first visit to the offices, and one of the board of
directors, &ldquo;it seems to me you had better look out for him
yourself; that young man is rising so fast, he&rsquo;s likely to
oust you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I guess not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Blaisdell confidently,
with his complacent smile, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you fellows
could get along without me, just yet. I don&rsquo;t know what
we would do with him, though, in case of any disagreement,
he&rsquo;s as independent as though he were a millionaire
instead of a salaried clerk; he would never care a rap
for anything we might say, he would take his own way
every time,&rdquo; and Mr. Blaisdell gave an account of his interview
with Houston at the Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Mr. Rivers contemptuously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better let me manage that fellow, Blaisdell, he&rsquo;ll run away
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll run away with those mines up there, Blaisdell,&rdquo;
chuckled Mr. Brunnell, peering over his glasses at the
general manager, who was strutting pompously about the
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you fellows may joke as much as you please,&rdquo;
said Mr. Blaisdell, a little testily, &ldquo;I tell you the man is
smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it! I know he&rsquo;s smart; I tell you he&rsquo;s too
damned smart for you!&rdquo; responded Mr. Rivers, who had
very little respect for Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s business ability, but
found him a very convenient cat&rsquo;s-paw.</p>
<p>As early as possible after the completion of the new arrangements
at the mines, Houston and Van Dorn, in accordance
with a previous engagement, visited Jack at his
cabin. The hour was late, and as they entered the room
already familiar to Houston, a lamp was burning brightly,
but a heavy screen hung over it, concentrating the light
upon the table beneath, on which lay various drawings
and tracings, and allowing only a dim light to pervade
the room.</p>
<p>Houston introduced Van Dorn, whom Jack greeted
with characteristic courtesy, though with something of
his old reserve, and having seated his guests, he at once
proceeded to the discussion of the business which had
brought them together.</p>
<p>In reply to an inquiry of his regarding the present situation
of affairs, Houston informed him of the arrangement
just completed by which he was to have entire
charge of the work at the mines for the next few weeks,
until the coming of Mr. Barden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your present position is much more favorable for your
work,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;it is exceedingly doubtful whether
the company will have any use for the services of Mr.
Barden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston then stated briefly what had been done since
Van Dorn&rsquo;s arrival, adding in conclusion, &ldquo;Of course,
we would have accomplished more within this time, had
it not been for the confusion and changes resulting from
Morgan&rsquo;s sudden death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that has hindered you temporarily,
but it will result to your advantage. All that I regretted
was that an examination which I hoped you and Mr.
Van Dorn might be able to make last week, immediately
upon his arrival, will now have to be postponed until
next week, but even that is better as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; inquired Houston, with much interest,
&ldquo;to what do you refer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to the Lucky Chance mine; are you familiar
with that property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not especially,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;I have paid no attention
to it, as it was not one in which our company was interested,
nor one of which I was in charge. Since the
recent change, I have visited the mine once with Mr.
Blaisdell, but we only went in a short distance, and he
informed me there was but little work done there, and
but few men employed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jack, with peculiar emphasis, &ldquo;but that
&lsquo;little work&rsquo; as he terms it yields the company a larger percentage
than any other single mine which they own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s face expressed considerable astonishment.
&ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;because I thought
I knew their best paying properties, and I never would
have supposed that was one of them, either from my own
observation, or from anything I have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be for the interests of the company to
have much said regarding the mine, or to have the workings
investigated very closely. You are probably aware
that the claim adjoins the Yankee Boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Houston, &ldquo;I am aware of that
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Jack, rising and going to the
table. &ldquo;I have prepared some diagrams here which I
would like you and Mr. Van Dorn to examine. Here
you will see,&rdquo; he continued, as they drew their chairs
near the table,&ldquo; the boundaries and underground workings
of the Lucky Chance mine, with their approximate
measurements. Please look them over and see if you
detect any irregularities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Houston and Van Dorn studied the diagram carefully
for a moment, when the latter exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the main tunnel extends more than a hundred
feet beyond the boundary line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now allow me to substitute this diagram,&rdquo; said Jack,
spreading a larger tracing before them. &ldquo;This is the same
as the other with the addition of a portion of the boundary
lines and underground workings of the adjoining
claim, the Yankee Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;the tunnel from the Lucky
Chance has been carried beyond the boundary line in
such a direction as to strike the vein of the adjoining
claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it exactly,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, &ldquo;no wonder the
mine pays well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I stated before,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;these measurements,
and, to a certain extent, the course of the tunnel,
are given approximately, as I had no means of ascertaining
the exact data, but I know they are essentially correct.
It only remains for you, gentlemen, to verify this,
by making an examination of the tunnel and taking the
courses and measurements exactly, and also by comparing
the ore now taken out with that originally found in
the mine, and with the ore of the Yankee Boy, and you
will then have evidence of the greatest fraud which has
been perpetrated upon the rightful owners of the Yankee
Boy, and which has been carried on for the last four or
five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you discover this?&rdquo; asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first came here,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;shortly after the
sale of the Yankee Boy group of properties had been consummated.
Within a few months afterward, the company
located the Lucky Chance mine; development work
was carried forward as rapidly as possible, quite a number
of men being employed, of which I was one. It was evident
that in locating this mine, the company hoped they
had struck an extension of the vein of the Yankee Boy
lode; it proved of an entirely different character, however,
yielding rather a low-grade ore. The claim was surveyed
and patented as soon as the necessary amount of improvements,
required by law, had been placed upon it.
After obtaining patent, the company then extended the
tunnel in an entirely different direction, and, as you will
find upon investigation, beyond the boundary line, until
it intersected a portion of the Yankee Boy vein. Here
a body of very rich ore was struck, and the mine has been
a paying property ever since. For this last work very
few men were retained, and but few have been employed
there since, those few being men whom the company
thought could be trusted, or upon whom they had some
hold by which they could compel them to silence. I was
employed there until very recently, and from the first
had a thorough understanding of the course and extent
of the different workings, and consequently am perfectly
familiar with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard,&rdquo; said Van Dorn, for whom work of this kind
possessed a special attraction, &ldquo;I think this is just about
the kind of an expedition we will like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;but at the same
time, it is the most risky piece of work we have yet undertaken,
and we will have to depend upon our friend
here for suggestions and advice. You will of course accompany
us?&rdquo; he added, turning to Jack, who had withdrawn
from the table and was sitting in the dim light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded Jack, &ldquo;it would be a very dangerous
undertaking for two strangers to go through that
part of the mine without a guide at any time, especially
at night, and it will be at best, a hazardous piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are employed there? and what class of
men are they?&rdquo; inquired Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a dozen on the night shift,&rdquo; Jack replied,
&ldquo;mostly Cornishmen, but whatever their nationality, it
is usually the most treacherous and brutal men that we
have that are employed by the company in that mine.
Maverick used to work there until he was transferred
above ground. It will not be necessary for us to come
in contact with very many of them, however, as they are
so widely scattered through the mine, and on the night
shift next week, there will be four men,&ndash;&ndash;a father and
three sons,&ndash;&ndash;who will do just about whatever I say, especially
if a little money is given them. Mr. Houston&rsquo;s
new position as superintendent, will aid us very materially.
A visit from him, with me as guide, will not excite
suspicion, but Mr. Van Dorn will be suspected in a moment,
and we must disguise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you assume the Irish dialect, on an occasion
like this, Mr. Van Dorn?&rdquo; Jack inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; shure,&rdquo; exclaimed Van Dorn, with the broadest
accent imaginable, &ldquo;an&rsquo; will yez be afther tellin&rsquo; me, be-dad!
why I should not shpake me own mither tongue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Houston and Jack laughed at Van Dorn&rsquo;s ready
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do,&rdquo; Jack said quietly, but in a tone so rich
and musical as to chain the attention of his guests while
he proceeded to plan the details of their visit to the mine.</p>
<p>In an hour or two, the modus operandi had been fully
decided upon, and nothing remained but to fix the night
for their expedition, and this it was thought best to leave
to be determined by circumstances the following week.
The instruments needed for taking measurements were to
be taken down beforehand by Houston, and concealed in
a safe place near the mine, and on the night of the examination,
he was to go from the house directly to the mine,
where he would be joined by Jack and Van Dorn, the latter
dressed in a suit of Mike&rsquo;s mining clothes, and personating
him as closely as possible.</p>
<p>All arrangements being now as nearly complete as possible,
Houston and Van Dorn bade their host a cordial
good night, and walked cheerfully homeward, in the cool,
night air, under the star-lit sky, all unconscious of a pair
of eyes, which from behind a large rock, had eagerly
watched for their appearance, and followed their every
movement.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Houston and Van Dorn disappeared around a turn
in the road, the figure of Haight emerged into the starlight
from behind a large rock where he had been concealed
most of the time during their stay at the cabin. Incidently
he had seen them on their way to visit Jack, and
the lateness of the hour combined with the direction in
which they were going, aroused his curiosity to such a
degree that he followed them at a distance, and having
seen them enter the cabin, his suspicious nature was at
once on the alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll find out what in the devil this means,&rdquo; he
said to himself, as he paused behind a rock at a little distance,
determined to ascertain what he could regarding
their movements.</p>
<p>It was a long and wearisome watch; once or twice he
ventured near the cabin, to see whether by closer observation
he could obtain any clue to what might be going
on within, but the closely shaded window gave no sign,
and beyond an occasional low murmuring of voices, nothing
disturbed the silence, except once a low, ominous
growl from Rex, as he caught sight of Haight&rsquo;s skulking
figure from his station just outside the door.</p>
<p>When at last the door opened, and Houston and Van
Dorn stepped forth into the calm night, the lynx-eyed
watcher failed to detect anything beyond a friendly leave-taking,
after which the two walked homeward, chatting
in the most commonplace manner imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he soliloquized, as he followed at a safe
distance, &ldquo;I wonder if I haven&rsquo;t had my labor for my
pains! But that did look mighty queer anyhow, their
going &rsquo;round to see the old chap, and I&rsquo;ll wager there&rsquo;s
something in it, too. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that Van
Dorn is out here in the interest of that old party who was
looking at mines a while ago, and with Houston&rsquo;s help
is going to get a few pointers. Jack knows pretty well
what is going on around here, and may be a little money
would make him talk. I&rsquo;m going to keep watch of some
of these smart people, and I know of one or two that will
help me about it. If I can get hold of anything, I&rsquo;ll report
it to Rivers; Houston has pulled the wool over
Blaisdell&rsquo;s eyes, but Rivers won&rsquo;t have anybody monkeying
round these mines, and if I can once put him on the
track, there&rsquo;ll be a few less of these swells about, and it
will be money in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late as it was when Houston and Van Dorn returned
to the house, Miss Gladden and Lyle had not retired.
Houston had told Miss Gladden the secret of his business
there in the mining camp, and, true to Lyle&rsquo;s prediction,
he had found her, while quick to realize the dangers of his
position, yet able to assist him by her readiness to enter
into his feelings, her interest in his plans and her timely
suggestions. Once she had met Jack since learning
Houston&rsquo;s secret, and in a few, well-chosen words, had
conveyed to him her knowledge of the fact that he was
giving her lover aid and protection in his work, and her
gratitude therefor.</p>
<p>She and Lyle were aware of the import of the visit to
the cabin that night, and they sat in the dusky shadows,
looking out into the night, alternately talking in low
tones, and listening for the return of Houston and his
friend.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was the first to catch the sound of her
lover&rsquo;s voice, as he and Van Dorn approached the house,
and a moment later, they heard the ringing laugh of the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are evidently in good spirits,&rdquo; remarked Lyle,
&ldquo;their visit must have been a satisfactory one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Dorn seems so jubilant they must have made
some new discoveries,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;he never
seems so happy as when he is ferreting out some fraud,
or unearthing some dishonest scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is material enough here to make his happiness
complete for some time,&rdquo; said Lyle rather bitterly, &ldquo;I
only wish every one of the guilty parties could be brought
to justice, but I doubt whether they ever will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden in surprise, &ldquo;do you
think Mr. Houston will fail after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that necessarily,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;but even
if he succeeds in getting his evidence together, and his
friends come out from the east, I do not believe they will
ever succeed in securing the ones who are most guilty,
who have planned and plotted the whole thing. Over
and over again, people whom they have wronged and defrauded
have brought suit against them, but to no purpose;
they are continually involved in litigation, but they
always manage to evade the law in one way or another,
I do not claim to understand how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not think they could escape with all the evidence
accumulating against them now,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied Lyle, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t
know them. Who is that?&rdquo; she asked suddenly, catching
sight in the dim light of a figure approaching the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like Haight,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;but why
is he creeping along so cautiously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he has been following Mr. Houston,&rdquo; said
Lyle, quickly, &ldquo;wait a minute, keep perfectly quiet, so he
will think every one is asleep up stairs,&rdquo; and in an instant,
she was going swiftly and noiselessly down the stairs.
The door at the foot of the stairs was partially open, and
Lyle could hear Haight, as, after opening the outside
door very carefully, he stepped lightly toward the room
occupied by Houston and Van Dorn; here he paused and
listened, but evidently hearing nothing, he cautiously
made his way across to the room of Mr. and Mrs. Maverick,
the door of which was ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Jim, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? What d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo; came the response in
a surly tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! don&rsquo;t make any noise,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Haight;
get up and come out on the porch, but be quiet about it;
I want to have a talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A muttered assent was given, and Haight tip-toed softly
out to the porch, and sat down.</p>
<p>Lyle crept up-stairs again to Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I believe Haight
must have seen or heard something;&rdquo; and she hastily told
what she had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she in conclusion, &ldquo;the window on the
porch is open, and as soon as they are both outside, I will
go there and listen. Even if I cannot hear all that is said
I will probably catch enough to learn what is going on.
You wait for me and keep perfectly quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, Maverick shuffled out on the
porch and sat down beside Haight with a growl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned pretty time, I sh&rsquo;d think, to talk! What in
hell do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were long enough getting out here,&rdquo; said
Haight, in his smoothest tones, all unaware of a figure
that had glided to the open window behind him, and now
knelt within six feet of him. &ldquo;Now quit your growling,
for you and I are good friends, Jim, and I want your advice.
Jim,&rdquo; he continued in a lower tone, &ldquo;what would
you think two fellows like Houston and Van Dorn would
want with that old chap, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; said Maverick, rather stupidly, &ldquo;what are ye
drivin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! you&rsquo;re half asleep, Jim! Your two dandy
boarders here only just came home about twenty minutes
ago; they&rsquo;ve been for the last three or four hours
down there in Jack&rsquo;s cabin, with the windows all shut
tight and curtains down, and still as death. What do you
suppose that means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned if I know,&rdquo; was the laconic response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jim, don&rsquo;t be so uncommunicative; there may
be something in this for you and me if we just put our
heads together, &lsquo;two heads are better than one,&rsquo; you know,
so set your thinking machine to work and grind out some
ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maverick, slowly, &ldquo;I dun&rsquo;no what that
Houston, damn him, would be runnin&rsquo; &rsquo;round after Jack
for, unless he wanted to get some p&rsquo;inters on the mines
some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, go ahead!&rdquo; said Haight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houston,&rdquo; continued Maverick, with an oath and applying
a vile epithet, &ldquo;is too all-fired smart to notice anybody,
and Jack&rsquo;s another, so they&rsquo;d be likely to hitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Haight, &ldquo;now what object would
he be likely to have in getting information from Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dun&rsquo;no,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;unless mebbe he&rsquo;s paid by
somebody on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Haight, &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got about the same
idea of it; it&rsquo;s my opinion he is paid by somebody, and
that somebody is Van Dorn, or whoever&rsquo;s backing him.
I don&rsquo;t put much stock in this machinery business of his;
he don&rsquo;t act like a fellow that needs to go peddling machines
about the country, and I notice he don&rsquo;t seem in
any great rush about putting it up, now he&rsquo;s got here;
he ain&rsquo;t one of the kind that has to rustle for a living, like
you and me. I think he&rsquo;s just out here getting pointers
on the mines for that old fellow that was here a while
ago, and he&rsquo;s probably paying Houston a good, round
sum for helping him along, and now they&rsquo;ve got Jack
roped in on the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maverick savagely, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s their game,
I guess &rsquo;twill be dead easy stoppin&rsquo; it any time we&rsquo;re a
mind to; these &rsquo;ere mines is awfully unsafe places for a
tenderfoot to be prowlin&rsquo; &rsquo;round in,&rdquo; and he laughed a
cruel laugh, very familiar to the listener at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented Haight, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better keep
close watch of these fellows, and if they get too fresh, just
have &rsquo;em laid out with a sandbag or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&rsquo;n that,&rdquo; said Maverick, &ldquo;to take &rsquo;em some time
in the mines; folks like them are likely to get dizzy and
fall some times, or get in the way of the ore buckets and
be knocked silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I want you to do; I&rsquo;ll keep
watch, and if I know of their going down to the cabin
again, I want you to put some men on to watch out for
them; we&rsquo;ll investigate and find out what is going on.
Put on what men you please, and have them report to
me, and we&rsquo;ll find out what this means, and make our
plans accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there&rsquo;s a damned ticklish place to get any of the
men to go late at night,&rdquo; said Maverick reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place is harnted, ye know, by the man on the
spotted horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Haight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact though; he rides up and down there once
in a while, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want ter see him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang your ghost!&rdquo; said Haight, impatiently, &ldquo;tell
your men if they see it to shoot it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do no good,&rdquo; responded Maverick
doggedly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sight of it brings bad luck, and sometimes
death. There was a fellow here two years ago, he
seen it one night, and the next day he was killed in the
mines; they said the ghost had called him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Haight, rising, &ldquo;It would be well if your
ghost would only call Houston and Van Dorn some
night; but I want you to do as I say, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle, who had caught nearly every word of this conversation,
now rose quickly and retreated to the kitchen,
knowing she would there be safe from detection, and
could also judge of their movements. Nothing further
was said, however; Haight went stealthily up-stairs to his
room, and Maverick, after cursing to himself a few moments,
was soon snoring profoundly, and Lyle then returned
to Miss Gladden&rsquo;s room. She felt a sickening sensation
as she repeated the conversation to her friend, and
realized all that it meant. Miss Gladden was inexpressibly
shocked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, my dear child, is it possible that they would go
to such extreme limits as that. I had thought that he
would be in danger of some assault in the dark, or something
of that kind, but to trap him in the mines! I never
dreamed of anything so cowardly, so dastardly! He will
be in constant danger in the performance of his daily
round of duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Leslie,&rdquo; said Lyle,&ndash;&ndash;for thus Miss Gladden had
of late requested her to address her,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I have told you,
you did not realize what a place this is, and the worst of
all is, that it is my father who is planning this, after all the
kindness which you and Mr. Houston have shown me!
What must you think of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you, my dear child? I love you and trust you the
same as ever,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Gladden impulsively, &ldquo;he
is no father of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle, in her grief, did not notice the import of Miss
Gladden&rsquo;s words, but she exclaimed passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never call that man father again as long as I
live, and if it ever comes to that, I will shoot him, rather
than let him injure Mr. Houston.&rdquo; Then, a moment later,
she added more calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not allow myself to become excited, I must
think and plan. Do you know, I was so glad that they
have not, as yet, found the real clue to what is going on,
and do not even suspect the truth, and they must not be
allowed even to surmise it; as long as they do not, Mr.
Houston is comparatively safe, and they must not be allowed
to watch him, or get any clue to his movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you prevent it, dear? You know the
country and the people so much better than I, that you
can plan and direct far better than I can; you command,
dear Lyle, and you will find me ready to obey, afraid of
nothing, not death itself, if I can only help him and save
him from his enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better write a note to him to-night, to give
him quietly in the morning, as you may not have an opportunity
for a long talk with him so early, and tell him
what I have told you. Then he can probably make arrangements
with Jack by writing, so that he will not need
to go to the cabin again at present; or, if necessary, I can
go for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will they do about their intended examination
of the mines? They will surely be watched then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All they can do is to make their plans as quietly and
secretly as possible, and then go prepared for the worst,
but I think I can help them there; I have a scheme of
my own, something that occurred to me while listening
to their conversation, which I will tell you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note was written, and it was nearly daylight, when
the two at last retired, to rest possibly, but not to sleep.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIV' id='CHAPTER_XXXIV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>For the next ensuing days there were no more visits to
the cabin. According to Lyle&rsquo;s suggestion, a few notes
were quietly exchanged between Houston and Jack; thus
their plans were maturing, while there was nothing which
outsiders could detect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haight had bestowed considerable attention
upon Miss Araminta Bixby, to the unspeakable delight
of that individual, and had so ingratiated himself
into her favor that she only too gladly consented to play
the part of spy on the movements of Houston and Van
Dorn. The two Maverick boys had also agreed to report
to him whatever they were able to learn concerning
these two.</p>
<p>Houston and Van Dorn, however, did not seem quite
so intimate of late. They were apparently as good friends
as ever, but were not so frequently seen together. Nearly
every evening, Van Dorn started out for a stroll, sometimes
with Lyle, sometimes alone, often sauntering in
the direction of the cabin, but never seen to enter; while
Houston, after spending an hour or two with Miss Gladden,
would walk down to the mines, and entering the various
tunnels, or descending the shafts of one mine and
another, would watch the night shift at their work, or inspect
the workings, occasionally taking measurements
here and there. On one of these trips Jack accompanied
him, and on their return, they completed the arrangements
for the visit to the Lucky Chance mine, the following
night.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the next day, Houston returned to
the house a little earlier than usual, having finished his
work for the day at the mines and mills, and as he with
Miss Gladden and Lyle, sat in the little porch, they were
joined a few moments later by Van Dorn. In low tones
the plans for the evening were discussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;we shall go prepared for
trouble, but I do not anticipate that we shall meet with
any. Even if we are watched, our course of procedure
will differ so slightly from what we have followed for a
week past, I think it will not excite suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have watched me so many evenings to no purpose,
they may be off guard to-night,&rdquo; said Van Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself that you will escape &lsquo;Minty&rsquo;s&rsquo;
espionage for a single night,&rdquo; replied Lyle, &ldquo;she would remain
out all night watching you to gain a smile from
Haight in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn laughed. &ldquo;So it is the charming Miss Bixby
whose watchful eye is upon me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
think I will have to enter the lists as Haight&rsquo;s rival, and
see if I cannot win such faithful devotion upon the right
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you are gone,&rdquo; said Lyle, &ldquo;I will soon be able to
tell whether there will be men sent out to watch you to-night;
and I shall act accordingly,&rdquo; she added, with a
smile at Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Maverick, what will you do?&rdquo; inquired
Van Dorn, &ldquo;you must not expose yourself in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be in no danger,&rdquo; she answered smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea what Lyle intends to do,&rdquo; said Houston,
&ldquo;but I have great confidence in her plans, for she
knows this class of people better than we, and I have
found her judgment to be relied upon, on every occasion
so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle&rsquo;s beautiful eyes spoke her thanks for his words of
appreciation, as she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what hour will you have completed the examination,
and be ready to leave the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably very near twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Houston replied,
&ldquo;we cannot accomplish our work much before that time,
and I do not wish to be out much later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lyle, merrily, but with a slightly mysterious
air, &ldquo;if you are out at that hour, you may see the
phantom horse and his rider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how is that?&rdquo; inquired Van Dorn wonderingly,
while Houston remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we see nothing more than phantoms, we shall be
very happily disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;if the ghost walks to-night,
don&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; and hearing some one enter the dining
room to make preparations for the evening meal, she
left them, and the subject of conversation changed immediately.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Houston started as usual for the
mines. There was nothing out of the ordinary course of
affairs in this, except that the leave-taking between him
and Leslie was unusually tender, but of this no one knew
but themselves. A little earlier, Van Dorn had left for
his customary stroll, giving Lyle an invitation to accompany
him, which she declined on the plea of being very
busy. She immediately withdrew to the kitchen, and
smiled to herself presently, as she saw Minty, with an air
of great importance, starting out in the same direction.
She had been gone about half an hour, when Lyle, who
was again seated in the porch, caught sight of her moon-shaped
face peering around the corner of the house in
frantic endeavors to attract Haight&rsquo;s attention. As he
was facing in almost an opposite direction, her efforts
were unavailing, and Lyle, who could with difficulty restrain
a smile, added to her embarrassment by inquiring
in the blandest tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Araminta? do you wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of her name, Haight turned suddenly,
just as the blushing Miss Bixby was stammering out his
name, and catching his eye, she began nodding vigorously,
to signify the importance of her errand.</p>
<p>For once, Haight&rsquo;s punctilious suavity upon which he
prided himself, deserted him, and exclaiming, partly in
anger, and partly as a blind, &ldquo;Confound it! what does the
fool want of me?&rdquo; he disappeared around the house, while
Lyle exchanged glances with Miss Gladden, and the inoffensive
young bookkeeper, recently imported from Silver
City, looked on in mute astonishment.</p>
<p>At the kitchen door, Haight found his agent and spy,
her face shining with delight that she at last had some
news to impart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s went in there to-night, Mr. Haight,&rdquo; she cried
breathlessly, &ldquo;I seen him; I&rsquo;ve watched him every night,
but he&rsquo;s never went in till to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; exclaimed Haight, angrily, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t
you come around and give me the tip on the quiet, instead
of standing there grimacing like an idiot, making
a fool of yourself and me, too? Where are the boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a greeting was too much for Minty, after her
faithfulness; her anger was too great even for words, she
was speechless and without deigning even a look at
Haight, she went into the house, and rushing to her
room, burst into a storm of tears, vowing then and there,
between her sobs, that she would tell Mr. Van Dorn every
word that Haight had said about him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lyle, from her post of observation in the
kitchen, saw Haight call Jim Maverick out from among
a group of miners who had congregated for an evening&rsquo;s
visit, and after a few words, Maverick signaled to one of
the miners, who, with his two companions, came over
and joined them. A few moments later the three started
down the road, and Lyle heard Haight&rsquo;s final instructions
to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get onto what those fellows are about, if you have to
stay till morning, and if you want any help, send Jake
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew the men; they were cruel and treacherous,
and she was confident that they were well armed, but
they were at the same time, cowards, and returning to
Miss Gladden, she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try my little experiment to-night, and I do not
believe there will be any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite dark when the men who had been sent to
watch for Van Dorn reached the little cabin. A lamp
was burning within, as could be told by the lines of light
around the edge of the dark shade at the window, but beyond
this, there was neither sign nor sound. Having assured
themselves that there was no way by which they
could ascertain what was going on within, the men sat
down behind a little clump of evergreens, and filling their
pipes, prepared to await developments. Scarcely had they
done so, however, when the light suddenly went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the divil do they think they&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; us?&rdquo; said
one of the men, with an oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seen us mos&rsquo; likely, and they&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to fool us
that there&rsquo;s nobody there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t play no such trick on us as that, damn &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
said the first speaker, but at that instant the cabin door
opened, and two figures came out. The men sprang
quickly to their feet, making no sound, and listening intently.
They heard the lock click in the door, and Jack&rsquo;s
voice bidding Rex take care of the house, to which he
barked in reply; and then came Mike&rsquo;s broad voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saints presarve us! but the baste knows more
than mony a mon, I&rsquo;m afther thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he does,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;and he is far more faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, astonished, slunk back into the brush, their
keen eyes watching every movement of the two as they
passed; there was no mistaking those figures, or the
rough clothes which they wore; it was Jack and Mike,
and their powerful muscle was too well known throughout
the camp, for any man, even the most brutal, to have
the slightest wish to tackle either of them.</p>
<p>As Jack and his companion passed out of hearing, the
men dropped to the ground, and for a moment the air resounded
with their profanity, while they held a brief consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tricked us, and that feller&rsquo;s hidin&rsquo; &rsquo;round
here,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;or else he went on ahead to the
mines; he hadn&rsquo;t no time to go back to the house, for
we&rsquo;d &rsquo;a met &rsquo;im. There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in the wind to-night,&rdquo;
he added with an oath, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to find out what
&rsquo;tis. You fellers git after them two and keep &rsquo;em in sight;
the boss is down there, and mebbe the other feller, too;
if ye see &rsquo;im, send Jake to me, and I&rsquo;ll come &rsquo;round there
and we&rsquo;ll lay for &rsquo;em. If he ain&rsquo;t there, he&rsquo;s here, hidin&rsquo;
somewhere, and I&rsquo;ll watch and settle his hash for &rsquo;im all
right when he does show up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better git some more of the boys,&rdquo; said Jake,
&ldquo;if we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to tackle them fellers with Jack and Mike
along; that ain&rsquo;t no kind of a job I&rsquo;m hankerin&rsquo; after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned fool!&rdquo; said the first speaker, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s
said anything &rsquo;bout Jack and Mike? They&rsquo;ll come back
the way they&rsquo;ve went, and them others will start up the
canyon for the house, and if we three can&rsquo;t hold &rsquo;em up,
my name ain&rsquo;t Pete Brody; now git!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and his partner had met Houston in the Yankee
Boy mine. As they emerged from the shaft a little later,
the piercing eyes of Jack and Houston caught a glimpse
of two figures skulking among the rocks at a distance.
Van Dorn was at a slight disadvantage, being somewhat
near-sighted, and having been obliged to take off his
glasses when donning Mike&rsquo;s costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know them,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;they are two of the three
that were outside the cabin, and one of them is about
the biggest coward that breathes; we could dispose of a
regiment of such men, but I prefer to get along without
trouble if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started for the other mine, Houston taking the
lead and Van Dorn following, while Jack brought up the
rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are following us,&rdquo; said Jack, after two or three
quick glances behind him, &ldquo;but at a distance; we will
probably have a nearer view of them later, when we leave
the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they proceeded through the tunnel of the Lucky
Chance mine, they met very few of the miners; they
touched their caps to Houston with a sort of sullen civility,
and greeted his companions with rough jests, which
Jack received with his usual taciturn manner, but to
which Van Dorn, from underneath his disguise, responded
with bits of Irish blarney and wit, which greatly
amused his associates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pete Brody, as he kept his solitary watch
before the cabin, was surprised by the sudden return of
Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have ye found &rsquo;im?&rdquo; he inquired eagerly, &ldquo;Is he down
there with the boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what in hell are you back here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud sent me,&rdquo; answered Jake; &ldquo;he said to tell ye
they&rsquo;ve gone into the Lucky Chance, and what do ye be
thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lucky Chance!&rdquo; exclaimed Pete, &ldquo;then there&rsquo;s
some diviltry a goin&rsquo; sure, for the old man, he don&rsquo;t let
nobody into that mine &rsquo;thout he&rsquo;s along; and if that Van-what&rsquo;s-his-name
ain&rsquo;t down there he&rsquo;s right here, that&rsquo;s
all, and here I stays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me and Bud, we&rsquo;re to watch out for the boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lay for &rsquo;im and overhaul &rsquo;im, and find out what
the divil is goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s a pretty tough feller to handle, from all
I&rsquo;ve heerd,&rdquo; remarked Jake reflectively.</p>
<p>Pete responded with an oath. &ldquo;Knock &rsquo;im silly, he&rsquo;ll
be easy &rsquo;nough handlin&rsquo; then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t mean for to do &rsquo;im up, do ye Pete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess nobody&rsquo;d feel very bad if ye did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake went down the road, and Pete was alone once
more. After waiting a while, he determined to ascertain,
if possible, whether there was any one within the cabin.
As he approached the door, there was a low savage growl
from the faithful watcher within. Very stealthily he tried
to open the door, but it was locked, and in response there
was such a furious onset upon the other side, accompanied
by such fierce growls, that he started back involuntarily.</p>
<p>It was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock, and Pete was growing
desperate, and anxious to put an end to his long watch.
He retreated to the road, and stood looking at the cabin,
trying to decide whether he should break in the window
and shoot the dog, and run the risk of being shot in return
by whoever might be concealed within, when his
attention was suddenly arrested by a strange sound, as
of heavily muffled footsteps close behind him. He turned
quickly, and in the starlight beheld a sight that seemed
to chill the blood in his veins. Not more than fifty feet
distant, and slowly approaching him, were the spotted
horse and his ghostly rider.</p>
<p>Every detail was perfect, like the description he had
often heard given by others who had seen the frightful apparition:
the man dressed in his miner&rsquo;s clothes, carrying
the empty bag from which the gold had been stolen; his
face ghastly white, and the blood streaming from his
breast, while horse and rider were partially shrouded by
a white covering which floated from behind them.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came those strange footsteps, closer
and closer the fearful sight, and still Pete stood, as if
turned to stone, his eyes starting from their sockets, his
hair rising, but unable to move or speak.</p>
<p>Suddenly a long, low groan issuing from the ghastly
lips seemed to break the spell, and with one terrible
shriek, Pete gave two or three bounds out of the road,
and ran for his life, jumping and leaping over the rocks
and through the brush, like a wild man.</p>
<p>The ghost gave a low, rippling laugh of satisfaction,
and turning the horse, rode rapidly back in the direction
from which it had come, until striking the road from the
house to the mines, where the horse trotted briskly for
some distance, but on nearing the mines, once more resumed
his funereal pace.</p>
<p>The two men concealed in the brush along the road
had no warning of the approaching phantom, until they
caught the sound of the strange footsteps, and peered
cautiously out, only to see the fearful sight that Pete beheld
shortly before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; exclaimed Jake, with a yell, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
ghost!&rdquo; The men jumped simultaneously into the road,
and started for the miners&rsquo; quarters, screaming like maniacs.
The ghost followed in swift pursuit until they were
some distance past the mines; the men then being safely
disposed of with no danger of their return, it turned slowly
in the direction of the Lucky Chance mine.</p>
<p>Houston and his friends, having accomplished their
task, stepped forth from the tunnel into the starlight,
looking carefully and searchingly in every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one to be seen at present,&rdquo; said Houston
in low tones, &ldquo;they may be concealed about here, or we
may meet them on the road to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;we must now proceed
with the utmost caution. Mr. Van Dorn and I will accompany
you to the house, and he had better then go with
me to the cabin, in case there should be spies watching
for our return, and it will be safer for him to remain there
until nearly daylight, as none of the men will be out at
that time, and he can return to the house unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had gone but a short distance, however, when,
passing around a curve in the road, they beheld a sight
that filled them with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shades of the departed!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston, &ldquo;what
kind of an apparition is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack studied the approaching figures for an instant, a
smile of amusement lighting up his usually stern features,
while Van Dorn hastily slipped on his glasses for a better
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;is evidently the famous phantom of
Spotted Horse gulch, but who has originated the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Lyle,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;she said the ghost
would walk to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, by George!&rdquo; exclaimed Van Dorn, &ldquo;that is pretty
good anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the ghost approached, giving the interested observers
an opportunity to note the details of the make-up;
the ghastly face, the heavy beard of dark colored wool,
the narrow strips of red flannel streaming from breast
and side, and even the heavy woolen socks upon the
horse&rsquo;s feet, muffling the sound of his steps. Suddenly
the slouch hat was raised, and the shining eyes of Lyle
looked out from the strange disguise, as she announced
in triumphant tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road is clear, and you are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;how did you ever think of this?
Did you devise this masquerade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea was mine,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it occurred to me
the other night while listening to their talk, but Miss
Gladden helped me to carry it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it a success?&rdquo; asked Van Dorn wonderingly,
having more practical knowledge of mines than of
miners, &ldquo;Were the men frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have thought so, could you have seen Pete
Brody,&rdquo; Lyle replied, with a low laugh, &ldquo;I believe he is
running yet, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Jake has lost
what few wits he ever possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of the best schemes that could have been
devised,&rdquo; said Jack, gravely, adding, &ldquo;We probably owe
you more than we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly and safely the little party proceeded up the
winding road, and having reached their several destinations,
all were soon at rest. Even the spotted horse, securely
stabled in his accustomed place, gravely munched
his wisp of hay without a thought of the ghostly escapade
in which he had borne so prominent a part.</p>
<p>But in the miners&rsquo; quarters consternation reigned, as
Pete and Bud related their experiences, Jake being utterly
incapacitated for speech. Even to Jack and Van
Dorn, Mike had a fearful tale to tell of the sight he had
witnessed, while alone with Rex in the cabin, and it was
some time before his perturbed Irish fancies could be
soothed; and &ldquo;the night that the ghost walked,&rdquo; was one
long remembered and frequently recalled by many of the
denizens of the little mining camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>
<p>After the events leading up to the examination of the
Lucky Chance mine, it was considered best for a while to
pursue very nearly the same line of conduct that had
been followed for the last ten days, carefully avoiding any
abrupt change which might attract attention. All necessary
data had now been secured, and Houston felt that he
could better afford to remain quiet for a brief time and
reconnoiter the situation, than by any hasty move to excite
further suspicion at the present time.</p>
<p>At the breakfast table the next morning, however, the
thoughts of all present were partially diverted into different
channels, by the arrival of a telegram for Houston
which proved to be a message from Ned Rutherford, to
the effect that he and his brother were on their way to
Silver City, and would be at the mining camp within the
next twenty-four or thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>Haight had been exceedingly angry on learning from
Maverick, early in the morning, of the failure of the men
to report anything definite concerning the movements of
those whom they had been sent out to watch. He had accomplished
nothing, and was uncertain what course next
to pursue, and he too, decided to remain quiet for the
present. He continued to watch Houston and Van Dorn,
his ugly suspicions only half concealed by the smiling exterior
which he tried to assume. He had hastened to
make peace with Minty, as he feared the results which
might follow should his plottings become known to
Houston, not dreaming that the latter had woven such
a web around, not the mining company alone, but including
also its principal employes, that in remaining
where he was, a fate far worse than his fears awaited him.</p>
<p>During the day, Miss Gladden and Lyle busied themselves
with preparations for the expected guests. A room
on the ground floor, adjoining and connecting with the
one occupied by Houston and Van Dorn, and with a
view of the lake and cascades, was put in readiness; and
books, sketches and bric-a-brac contributed by Houston
and Miss Gladden, and tastefully arranged by Lyle, relieved
the blank walls and plain furniture, and made the
place look quite attractive.</p>
<p>Houston was jubilant over the information acquired
by their expedition of the previous night; nothing out
of the usual course occurred that day, and returning earlier
from his customary visit to the mines than he had
done of late, the remainder of the evening was devoted to
music and song.</p>
<p>After Miss Gladden and Lyle had gone up-stairs, they
sat for some time talking over the events of the last few
days, and anticipating the coming of Rutherford and his
brother on the morrow. Many were Miss Gladden&rsquo;s surmises
regarding the stranger, and Lyle then learned for
the first time that he was an intimate friend of Houston&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard tells me that though Ned is a pleasant fellow
and good hearted, yet he is not in the least like his brother.
He says Morton, as he always calls him, is a most
perfect gentleman in every sense of the word, and a
scholar of rare intellectual attainments, fond of scientific
research, and a brilliant writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judged from his picture that the two brothers were
very unlike,&rdquo; said Lyle, &ldquo;and from your description he
will be in many respects a new specimen to come under
my limited observation; I will have to make a study of
him, and see if he is at all like my idea of a literary person.
I would not suppose, though, there would be much
to interest him here; the only rarities he will find are possibly
new phases of ignorance and coarseness and crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden thought, as she looked at Lyle, that if
the new-comer did not find rare beauty of mind and soul,
as well as of form and face, in that secluded region, he
certainly must be very unappreciative; but she only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have forgotten what Ned said of his
brother, that his love of the beautiful was so intense, he
doubted whether he would ever want to leave the scenery
and surroundings here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was simply one of Mr. Rutherford&rsquo;s extravagant
expressions,&rdquo; Lyle replied, &ldquo;the natural surroundings
here are certainly beautiful, but their beauty only makes
the conditions mentally and morally the more painfully
conspicuous, and if I can see the contrast so plainly, who
have always lived here and known no other life, how must
it look to one such as he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you always insist upon it so strongly that
you have never known any other life than this?&rdquo; inquired
Miss Gladden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Lyle, in surprise, &ldquo;I suppose simply because
it is a fact, the one hateful truth that I despise, and
so I say it over and over to myself, to check these foolish
dream-fancies of mine, that seem as if I had known something
better sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle spoke with more bitterness than Miss Gladden
had ever heard before, and the latter answered gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were in your place, Lyle dear, I would not try to
check these fancies; I would encourage them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle gazed at her friend in astonishment. &ldquo;Encourage
them!&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your meaning,
why would you advise that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see to what they would lead, my dear.&rdquo; Then, as
Lyle looked bewildered, she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it never occur to you, Lyle, that these fancies,
as you call them, might possibly be an effort on the part
of memory to recall something, long ago forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of such a possibility,&rdquo; she replied,
slowly.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden threw one arm about her caressingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these were mere fancies why should they occur so
persistently, and why should there be this sense of familiarity,
of which you have spoken, with other and far different
associations than these, unless there is some distinct
image hidden away in the recesses of your brain,
which your mind is trying to recall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle had grown very pale; she had caught the idea
which Miss Gladden was trying to convey, and her form
trembled, while her lips and delicate nostrils quivered
with suppressed agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do you mean that you think it
possible there is any reality in it,&ndash;&ndash;that I have ever known
a different life from this,&ndash;&ndash;a life anything like that which
seems to come back to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it not only possible, but probable,&rdquo; said her
friend, drawing the trembling girl closer to herself, &ldquo;and
that is why I want you to encourage these impressions,
and see if you will not, after a time, be able to recall the
past more definitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you believe this?&rdquo; questioned Lyle, &ldquo;How
did you ever think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you first told me of your fancies, as you called
them, and of your dreams, constantly recurring since
your earliest childhood, I felt that they must be produced
by something that had really occurred, some time
in the past, but perhaps so long ago that only the faintest
impression was left upon your mind; but however faint,
to me it seemed proof that the reality had existed. The
more I have questioned you, the more I have become
convinced of this, and I find I am not alone in my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you talked with Jack, and does he think as you
do?&rdquo; Lyle questioned. Miss Gladden answered in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the reason he has asked me so often regarding
my early life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has questioned you, hoping you might be
able to recall something of those years which you say
seem to you only a blank. We can only surmise regarding
your early life, but if you could recall some
slight incident, or some individual, it might prove whether
our surmises were correct.&rdquo; Then, as Lyle remained
silent, Miss Gladden continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That face which you always see in your dreams, must
be the face of some one you have really seen and known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lyle answered dreamily, &ldquo;I have often thought
of that, and have tried to remember when, or where, it
could have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments, both were silent; Lyle, in her abstraction,
loosened her hair, and it fell around her like
a veil of fine-spun gold. An idea suddenly occurred to
Miss Gladden, and rising from her chair, she gathered
up the golden mass, and began to rearrange and fasten
it, Lyle scarcely heeding her action, so absorbed was she
in thought.</p>
<p>When she had completed her work, she looked critically
at Lyle for a moment, and seeming satisfied with the
result, asked her to look in the glass. Half mechanically,
Lyle did as requested, but at the first glance at the face
reflected there, she uttered a low cry, and stood as if
transfixed. Miss Gladden had arranged her hair in a
style worn nearly twenty years before, and in imitation
of the photograph which Jack had shown her. The
effect was magical, as it showed Lyle&rsquo;s face to be an
exact counterpart of the beautiful pictured face.</p>
<p>To Lyle it revealed much more, for to her astonished
gaze there was brought back, with life-like distinctness
and realism, the face of her dreams; the one which she
had seen bending tenderly over her since her earliest
recollection, and which had seemed so often to comfort
her in the days of her childish griefs when she had sobbed
herself to sleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Miss Gladden saw the face in the glass grow
deathly white, and Lyle, quickly turning toward her
friend, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now! That is my mother&rsquo;s face that I have
seen in my dreams! And I have seen it living some time,
somewhere, but not here. These people are not my parents;
I am no child of theirs. Oh, Leslie, tell me, is
this true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very gently Miss Gladden soothed the excited girl, telling
her that while her friends knew nothing as yet, for a
certainty, regarding her parentage, they felt that she, in
her early life, had had a home and surroundings far different
from those she knew here, and that they hoped ere
long, with her help, to arrive at the whole truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did I ever come to live here with these people?&rdquo;
inquired Lyle, a new fear dawning in her eyes, &ldquo;do
you suppose they were hired to take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;as nearly as we can
judge, you must have been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think my own parents are now living?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>So far as she was able to do so, Miss Gladden explained
the situation, as Jack had told it to her, making
no reference, however, to what he had said regarding the
possibility of Lyle&rsquo;s friends coming to the mountains,
where they would be likely to recognize her. Of this,
Miss Gladden herself understood so little, she thought
best not to allude to it now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why has Jack never told me of this, and of my
mother? He must have known her,&rdquo; said Lyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember, dear, that he had no proof that
any such relation really existed; as I understood him, he
with others, supposed that this child was not living, but
he was struck with the resemblance between you and the
mother of this child, and the relationship occurred to him
at first as the merest possibility, but grew almost to a
certainty, as the resemblance between you increased; and
yet, you can see that under the circumstances, while you
were under the control and in the power of these people,
it would not be best to say anything until he had some
proof as to your identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Lyle answered, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but now that I
remember her as my mother, do you suppose that he
would talk with me about her, or help me to find my true
relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know how to answer you,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden
slowly, &ldquo;there is some mystery about it all, dear, that I do
not understand; he might perhaps talk more freely with
you, but with me he appeared willing to say very little
regarding your mother, or your friends. Still, he gave
me a hint, so vague and shadowy I scarcely understood
it, but to the effect that he thought there might, before
long, be an opportunity for a meeting between you and
those whom he believed to be your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lyle, after a pause, &ldquo;Jack is a true friend
to me, he knows what is best, and I can afford to wait with
even such a possibility to look forward to. I will not
wait in idleness either, I shall try to find some clue, some
evidence as to who I really am, and something tells me I
will succeed.&rdquo; Then she added tenderly, &ldquo;Do you know,
I believe, whoever my mother may have been, Jack must
have loved her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly was very dear to him,&rdquo; replied Miss
Gladden.</p>
<p>They talked till far into the morning hours, and as
they finally separated for the night, Lyle approached her
friend, and throwing her arms about her neck, she exclaimed,
almost in tears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leslie, you can never know how glad I am that
you have shown me this, and shown it to me to-night! I
have felt so disgraced, so degraded by the life here, it
seemed as if I were a part of it all, a part of my own hateful
surroundings but now, I know I am not; now,&rdquo; she
continued, lifting her head proudly and raising her arms
slowly with a beautiful gesture, &ldquo;they can fetter me no
longer! The chains that have held me so long and so
cruelly are already bursting; even now, I can rise above
them; soon, I shall be free!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>Do coming events cast their shadows before? Did the
silently-waving pinions of the angel who &ldquo;troubled the
waters&rdquo; give any hint of his beneficent approach? However
that may be, certain it is that on the morning of the
day in which the hitherto untroubled depths of Lyle&rsquo;s
womanly nature were to be stirred by the mightiest of influences,
there came to her a prescience, thrilling and
vibrating through her whole being, that this day was to
be the crisis, the turning point of her life. On that day,
she was to meet one whose influence upon her own life
she felt would be far greater than that of any human being
she could recall.</p>
<p>Lyle was not in love. As yet, she knew nothing of
what love might be, but she possessed rare depth of feeling.
In her lonely, secluded life, she had known few
emotions, but those few were deep and lasting; and when,
a few months before, she had incidentally seen the photograph
of Morton Rutherford,&ndash;&ndash;only one among many,
all unknown to her,&ndash;&ndash;it had left an impression upon her
heart and brain, never to be effaced.</p>
<p>His was no ordinary face; it would attract the most
casual observer, and to one gifted with Lyle&rsquo;s wonderful
insight and perception, and possessing her fine susceptibilities,
there would be revealed such rare strength and
beauty of mind and character combined, that, once seen,
it might not be easily forgotten.</p>
<p>To Lyle, in her isolation, it seemed a glimpse of a
kindred soul, and she had often wondered what the living
face itself might be, and what acquaintance and friendship
with such a soul might mean. She had looked forward
to his coming to the camp with mingled pleasure
and dread. She thoroughly understood the position
which she held in the estimation of the younger Mr.
Rutherford; would his brother regard her with the same
half pitying, half patronizing admiration? Would her
narrow, restricted life seem so small and poor to him, with
his superior attainments, that he would altogether ignore
her? Or would he be able, like Mr. Houston and Miss
Gladden, to overlook her hateful and hated environment,
and help her rise above it?</p>
<p>These were the questions which for the past few weeks
had perplexed and troubled her; but the revelation which
had come to her on the previous night had changed the
whole current of her thought. What matter now, how
mean or debasing her surroundings, since no taint from
them could attach itself to her? What matter if her life
had been cramped and restricted, since she was soon to
rise above it into the life for which she had been created?
Perhaps her natural sphere was not, after all, so unlike
that in which her friends moved, to which even he was
accustomed, the stranger, whose coming she now anticipated
with a strange, unaccountable thrill of expectation.
Would he, with that wonderful power which she felt he
possessed, to elevate or to crush the souls with whom he
came in contact, would he recognize her true sphere, as
her other friends had done, or would he be blinded by her
surroundings?</p>
<p>She could not rest; she rose and looked forth upon the
glorious dawn of the new day, and was impressed as
never before, with the beauty of the vision which met her
eyes. To her, it seemed like the dawning of a new epoch
in her life; nay, more than that, like the dawning of a
new life itself.</p>
<p>Impatient of restraint, she left the house, and went out
into the morning fresh from the hand of the Creator,
as yet undefiled by contact with human life. Hastily
climbing a series of rocky ledges, she reached a broad
plateau, and looked about her. The life which she had so
hated and despised seemed suddenly to have dropped forever
out of sight, and she was conscious only of a new
beauty, a new glory surrounding her.</p>
<p>The mountains, blushing in the first rosy light, lifted
their gleaming, glory-crowned spires heavenward; the
cascades chanted in thunderous, yet rhythmic tones, their
unceasing anthem of praise, their snow-white spray ascending
skyward, like clouds of incense, while the little
flowers, clinging to rock and ledge and mountain-side,
turned their sweet faces upward in silent adoration. The
place seemed pervaded by a spirit of universal adoration
and praise, and instinctively, Lyle bowed her head in
silent worship; and as she did so, there came to her, as
though revealed by the lightning&rsquo;s flash, the vision of her
mother kneeling beside her, in those dim days so long
ago, clasping her tiny hands within her own, and teaching
her baby lips to lisp the words of prayer.</p>
<p>For a long time she knelt in that temple made without
hands, till mountain and valley were bathed in glorious
sunlight; and when at last, she descended the rocky footpath,
she felt, as she looked forth upon the new life opening
before her, no fear, no shrinking, but strong to go
forward and meet her destiny, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>All were impressed that morning by Lyle&rsquo;s manner,
the added dignity of bearing, the new expression that
looked forth from her soulful eyes, though none but Miss
Gladden understood the cause.</p>
<p>At the breakfast table, the final plans were made for
the reception of the guests to arrive that day. Word had
been received that they were already in Silver City, and
would come out on the noon train. Houston had telegraphed
to the Y for the best team there to be in readiness
to bring them up to the camp, and an hour or so before
noon, he and Van Dorn were to take two horses and ride
to the Y to meet them, and accompany them on their
ride up the canyon. A late dinner was to be served upon
their arrival, when the two ladies would be present, as
Lyle no longer acted in the capacity of waiter, Miss Gladden
having some time before insisted that she should preside
at the table, and the blushing Miss Bixby, after much
painstaking effort, having been finally educated up to
the point of performing that ceremony very creditably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden after breakfast, as Houston
stopped for his customary chat with her before starting
out on his daily routine, &ldquo;did you observe Lyle this
morning? I never saw her look so lovely;&rdquo; adding playfully,
&ldquo;I wonder you did not fall in love with her, she is
far more beautiful than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to be judge,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;though I will admit
that I think she grows more beautiful every day.
But as to falling in love with her, I doubt if I would have
done that even had I not met you. From the first she
has seemed to me unaccountably like a sister; I cannot
explain why, unless it was because of that child-like, almost
appealing manner she had at that time. She has
none of it now, however, she is developing very rapidly
into a noble womanhood, and yet I still have the same
feeling toward her, and I think she regards me as a
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Miss Gladden, &ldquo;she cares for you
more than for any of the others, but only, as you say, as
a brother. Her heart does not seem to be very susceptible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be none the less susceptible,&rdquo; Houston replied,
&ldquo;but she realizes her position here, and she is far
too proud spirited to carry her heart upon her sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gladden then related to Houston the events oi
the preceding night, and Lyle&rsquo;s sudden recollection of
her own mother. He was much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more than glad,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;doubtless the
memory of her early childhood will gradually come back
to her, and we may be able to ascertain her true parentage.
I hope so, at least, for I believe Maverick to be an out
and out scoundrel, capable of any villainy, and I would
like to see him brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room set apart for the expected guests, as well as
the dining-room, was decorated with wild flowers and
trailing vines, and in this pleasant employment, and the
preparation of a few dainty dishes for the table, the forenoon
passed swiftly.</p>
<p>The noon train had scarcely come to a stop at the little
station at the Y, when Ned Rutherford was seen rushing
impetuously from the car, his camera case as usual in one
hand, at sight of which the two young men waiting on the
platform burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;the same old Ned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same old boy!&rdquo; added Van Dorn, as they
hastened to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Everard!&rdquo; cried Ned, jumping upon the platform,
&ldquo;I say, but it seems mighty good to see you again!
How are you, Van Dorn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Ned?&rdquo; said Van Dorn, extending his
hand, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t have known you if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
that camera box of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; answered Ned, good-naturedly, &ldquo;well, I always
considered it indispensable, but I didn&rsquo;t suppose my
identity would be lost without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Houston had hastened to meet the elder
brother, and it could readily be seen that they were more
than ordinary friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard, old fellow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in response to
Houston&rsquo;s greeting, &ldquo;this is the greatest pleasure I&rsquo;ve had
in many a day. I never dreamed that the Houston of
whom Ned wrote such glowing accounts was my old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think sometimes,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;when
Ned was writing you, that I would like to send you some
reminder of old times, a college password or signal that
you would understand; but at that time, I didn&rsquo;t know
Ned very well, and of course I was anxious to conceal
my identity here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was right,&rdquo; said the elder Rutherford, with a
comical glance at his brother, &ldquo;Ned is rather injudicious,
he belongs to that unfortunate class of people, with the
best of intentions, who usually succeed in doing as much
mischief as others with the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are there,&rdquo; said Ned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always putting
my foot in it one way or another; I wouldn&rsquo;t advise anybody
to make a confidant of me, I&rsquo;d give them away sure.
I say, Everard,&rdquo; he continued, while his brother and Van
Dorn exchanged cordial greetings, &ldquo;how are you getting
on, and how is the Buncombe-Boomerang combination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been very successful so far, everything is
nearly in readiness, and the combination as you call it,
cannot exist much longer; we will give you full particulars
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are the ladies?&rdquo; Ned inquired further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are well, and waiting to give you and your
brother a royal welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Morton Rutherford replied, &ldquo;I am quite
anxious to meet them, Ned, of course, can speak for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he can, and generally does when the right time
comes,&rdquo; responded that individual, &ldquo;you will find I am a
universal favorite here, in the camp of the Philistines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little while they were on their way to camp, Houston
and Morton Rutherford occupying the back seat
of the light, canopy-top wagon, while Van Dorn and
Ned took the forward seat with the driver, the horses and
baggage following with one of the mining teams.</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford gave his friend a glowing account
of his journey through the west, dwelling at considerable
length on his enjoyment of the scenic routes. As
they wound upward through the canyon, he grew ecstatic
over the wild beauty and rugged grandeur extending
in every direction, and when they finally drew rein before
the long, low boarding house, nestling at the foot of
the mountain, with its rustic, vine-covered porch, and
surrounded on all sides by the wild scenery of that region,
his admiration knew no bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a delightful retreat!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what a
study for an artist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within the porch, among the vines, the ladies awaited
their coming, and Lyle, looking forth from her shady retreat,
saw the face whose image had been imprinted on
heart and brain, and at a glance she read all she had expected
to find, and more. There were the fine features,
expressing such depth and power, and yet such delicacy
of thought and feeling, the intellectual brow, the dark,
expressive eyes, all as she had seen them in the picture;
but what picture could convey the living beauty of the
whole? It was the face of one whom women would
worship, and men would follow even to death.</p>
<p>The gentlemen approached the house, Houston and
his friend leading the way. Miss Gladden advanced to
meet them, and as Houston introduced Mr. Rutherford,
she extended to him a most gracious and graceful welcome,
and also to Ned. Her gown was white, of soft,
clinging material, trimmed with quantities of rich, rare
lace, and brightened here and there with touches of
crimson and gold. She wore a few costly jewels, and the
diamond hilt of a tiny dagger glistened and scintillated
in her auburn-tinted hair. She looked very beautiful,
and as Mr. Rutherford paused to respond to her welcome
with a few courteous words, he thought his friend
was surely to be congratulated on the prize he had won.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ned had discovered Lyle, as she stood
partially hidden among the vines, awaiting her turn, and
hastened to greet her in his impetuous fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Maverick? I&rsquo;m awfully glad
to see you. I want you to know my brother,&rdquo; and his
cheerful voice sounded on his brother&rsquo;s ear, as he replied
to some remark of Miss Gladden&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morton, I want to introduce you to our nightingale;
Miss Maverick, allow me to make you acquainted with
my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a rare smile lighting up his face, Morton Rutherford
turned toward the speaker, and as he did so, saw a
vision of the most royal young womanhood his eyes had
ever beheld. She, too, was dressed in white, but it was
a filmy, cloud-like mass, with trimmings of ethereal blue.
She wore no jewels, but a crown of golden hair gleamed
like a coronet above her head, and her delicately molded
face had a spirituelle beauty and radiance unlike any
living face he had ever seen, and which he could only
compare to the exquisite Madonna faces, painted by
artists of the old world, and of the olden time.</p>
<p>And Lyle, coming forward with unconscious, queenly
grace, looked for an instant into that face whose subtle
power she already felt, her wondrous, starry eyes, luminous
with a new, strange light, meeting his with their
depth of meaning, their powerful magnetism, and from
that brief instant, life for each was changed, wholly and
completely; whether for good or ill, for weal or woe,
neither as yet could say.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a very congenial little company that somewhat
later gathered about the dinner table. There were no
outsiders present on this occasion to check their conversation,
and the room resounded with merry laughter as
the young men related various reminiscences of their
college days, or as Lyle gave her eastern friends some
amusing glimpses of western life.</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford added his share to the general enjoyment,
as he gave in an inimitable manner which fascinated
his listeners, sketches of places and people he had
met in his western journey; but a close observer would
have noticed that his dark eyes often wandered to the
face of the fair hostess, presiding at the table with such
dignity, and his thoughts much of the time were far removed
from the subject of conversation.</p>
<p>Of the strange, wild tumult in Lyle&rsquo;s breast there was
no token, save in her heightened color, and the added
brilliancy of her eyes.</p>
<p>The plain, but wholesome mountain fare disappeared
rapidly before the appetites sharpened by the bracing air
of that altitude, and still the little company lingered at
the table, loath to tear themselves away.</p>
<p>Plans were made for a few days and evenings of genuine
enjoyment, before proceeding any further with the
business in which all were so deeply interested. Houston
and Van Dorn would of course be more or less confined
by their work, and it was voted that, during the day, Mr.
Rutherford should be entertained by the ladies, or, as
the hunting and fishing season had now opened, he and
Ned would be able to find considerable sport in the surrounding
country. But the evenings were to be spent by
the entire party in visits to the different points of interest
and beauty already familiar to some of their number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of the first places to visit,&rdquo; said Ned Rutherford,
at this point in the conversation, &ldquo;will be the cascades;
we will go out there in boats, you know, with the
guitar and violin, and have music just as we did the first
time we ever went out. Great Scott! but I never will
forget that night as long as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the ladies&rsquo; approval, that will be one of our first
trips,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You play and sing, do you not, Mr. Rutherford?&rdquo;
Miss Gladden inquired, addressing the elder brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, occasionally,&rdquo; he answered, with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What instrument do you use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can accompany myself on several different instruments,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;but the violin is my favorite; it is
capable of more expression than most others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the little party adjourned to the porch, and
Lyle, under the pretext of some household duties, excused
herself, and escaped to her own little room. Here
her forced composure gave way, and her highly wrought
feelings found relief in a passionate burst of tears, though
why she wept, she could not have told.</p>
<p>Unconsciously to herself, perhaps, Morton Rutherford
had of late become the hero of her thoughts, partially
on account of her high estimate of him, and also because
of the sympathy which she felt would exist between
them in taste and thought and feeling. She had dreamed
of a friendship with him, perhaps more perfect and helpful
than any she had yet known; but they had met, and
in that one glance had been revealed to her a natural
affinity deeper than any of which she had ever dreamed,
and the impossibility of a calm, Platonic friendship between
kindred spirits such as theirs.</p>
<p>Unconsciously to herself, Lyle had that day crossed the
great divide, and womanhood, with its dower of love and
joy, of pain and suffering, was henceforth hers. The
mightiest element in her nature, which had lain dormant
all these years, its power unsuspected even by herself,
was now aroused, and even while she felt the throbbing of
its new life, as yet, she knew not its name. She was
young, her observation and her experience had been limited,
and there had been no one to prepare her for the
certain awakening of this mighty power, before whose
conquering sway all else must yield.</p>
<p>She grew more calm, and as she reviewed the few
friendships she had known,&ndash;&ndash;the helpful kindness and
tenderness of Jack in whom she had confided her childish
griefs, the chivalry of Everard Houston, who from the
first had constituted himself her champion and protector,
and even the pleasant kindliness of Ned Rutherford,
whom she scarcely deemed more than an acquaintance,&ndash;&ndash;there
was suddenly revealed to her quickened perception
the distinction between friendship and love, and instantly
she recognized the stranger who had taken possession of
her heart: Love had come. Love was to be henceforth
king, and she stood trembling and abashed in the presence
of the new sovereign. Her tears flowed silently, but
she was far from unhappy; love, even unknown and unreciprocated,
brings its own sweet reward.</p>
<p>Whether her love would ever be returned by the one
whose glance had awakened it in its might, she dared not
even think. She knew not, as yet, in what light he would
regard her. Notwithstanding the friendship and esteem
manifested by the younger brother, she fully understood
the insurmountable barrier which his pride had placed
between himself and her. Would it exist in the mind of
the elder brother also? Or would his keener insight, his
superior perception discern her true position? Time
alone would tell.</p>
<p>A little later, calm and queenly as ever, Lyle rejoined
the little group, who had strolled out a short distance
from the house, and were seated beside the lake, in the
cooling shadow of a large rock.</p>
<p>She could not help observing the smile of pleasure with
which Mr. Rutherford welcomed her approach, but she
would not yet trust herself to hold any protracted conversation
with him, and giving him only a bright little smile
of recognition, she seated herself beside Ned, and began
a playful badinage, as they had been accustomed to banter
each other on his former visit. Morton Rutherford
watched them curiously, listening to the war of words
with a half smile, and evidently absorbed in his own
thoughts, as, for a while, Miss Gladden and Mr. Van
Dorn had the conversation to themselves, Houston having
gone to the mines.</p>
<p>As the shadows began to lengthen, and the sun seemed
hovering over a snow-crowned peak that stood out boldly
against the western horizon, Houston was seen approaching
the house, and at a little distance, Maverick and his
two sons. Lyle, who was then standing on the outer
edge of the group, talking with Miss Gladden, was quick
to observe a sudden movement on Ned&rsquo;s part, as, turning
toward his brother, he made some brief remark in
low tones, regarding the approaching trio. She well
knew the tenor of his remark, and watched closely to see
its effect.</p>
<p>She saw Morton Rutherford glance in the direction indicated
by a slight motion of Ned&rsquo;s head, and then,
though he betrayed no surprise by word or movement, an
expression of astonishment crossed his face, but only for
an instant. His features grew white and stern, and he
watched every movement of the three figures, as, with
stealthy, slouching gait and suspicious looks, they stole
around the corner of the house, and the expression of
his eye seemed to Lyle like that of a judge passing sentence
on a condemned criminal.</p>
<p>He did not look at Lyle immediately, perhaps he was
conscious of the eyes watching him so narrowly from
under the heavily drooping lids, fringed with long, golden
lashes, but when he did look toward her, there was a
depth of meaning in those dark eyes which she could not
fathom.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours before, Lyle standing there, under
those circumstances, would have been crushed with humiliation,
but in the light of the revelation of the night
before, she met his glance with an expression which to
him seemed utterly inscrutable. There was neither
shame nor apology written on her face, as with a calm,
bright smile, and the same self-possessed manner, she
turned and passed into the house.</p>
<p>Upon entering the dining-room, Lyle heard angry
words in the kitchen, and paused to listen. The voice
was Maverick&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in hell is that new feller you&rsquo;ve got up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the brother of the young feller that was here
a spell ago,&rdquo; answered the voice of Minty, who was just
emerging from the pantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you! who asked you to say anything? Git out
of here,&rdquo; he roared, and Minty made a hasty retreat into
the cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that new feller out there?&rdquo; he again demanded
of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Rutherford, and he&rsquo;s a brother of the
young man that come out here with Mr. Houston,&rdquo; was
her reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his business here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he hain&rsquo;t got none, he seems to be out here
for pleasure like his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasure!&rdquo; growled Maverick, with an oath, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
too many of &rsquo;em, damn &rsquo;em, out here for pleasure; I&rsquo;d
give some of &rsquo;em some pleasure that they ain&rsquo;t a lookin&rsquo;
for, if I had a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife made no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that girl Lyle tricked out in such finery for?&rdquo;
he next asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re clothes that Miss Gladden give her,&rdquo; Mrs.
Maverick replied, &ldquo;and it saves us jest so much, so you
needn&rsquo;t growl; besides she looks nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks nice!&rdquo; said Maverick, contemptuously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
always bound to stick up for her! Look here, old woman,&rdquo;
he added, in a lower tone, but which Lyle could hear,
&ldquo;have you been tellin&rsquo; that girl anything? She don&rsquo;t
own me for her daddy lately, I notice; now, if you&rsquo;ve
been puttin&rsquo; her or anybody else onto anything of the
kind, I can tell you you&rsquo;ll be damned sorry for it before
you git through with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t said a word, it&rsquo;s jest a notion she&rsquo;s took, I
dun&rsquo;no why. I hain&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; nor I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo;
to, as long as you behave yourself, Jim Maverick, but the
proofs is all ready in case you don&rsquo;t treat me and her jest
as you&rsquo;d orter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A terrible oath burst from Maverick&rsquo;s lips, but the entrance
of the two boys and Minty, prevented any further
conversation on this subject; and Lyle, seated in the
little porch whither she had retreated from the dining-room,
reflected on what she had just heard, its meaning
seeming very clear to her in the light of what Miss Gladden
had told her the night before.</p>
<p>There were proofs then in existence, probably in that
very house, as to her identity. Her friends were correct
in their surmises: she had been stolen, and the villain who
had committed the deed, even now trembled with apprehension
lest his villainy should become known. Those
proofs she must have, and it would be worse than useless
to demand them of either Maverick or his wife. She
must search for them. This she resolved to do, day by
day, as opportunity afforded, until there should be no
nook or corner which she had not thoroughly explored.</p>
<p>As Lyle recalled all that occurred within the past
twenty-four hours, the most eventful period within her
recollection thus far, she felt that she had virtually broken
with the old life and all its associations, and that she
stood upon the threshold of a new life, higher, nobler,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
sweeter,&ndash;&ndash;than any of which she had ever
dreamed.</p>
<p>The return of the little company of friends to the house
interrupted her thoughts, but not before she had decided
fully as to her future course.</p>
<p>After supper, it was decided to spend that first evening
on the summit of one of the nearest mountains, to watch
the glories of the sunset, and to give Morton Rutherford
a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the beautiful scenery, before introducing
him to its details.</p>
<p>But on the second evening, the entire party set forth for
the trip to the cascades, for which Ned was so especially
desirous.</p>
<p>Mr. Houston and Miss Gladden led the little procession,
Houston carrying her guitar. Ned had constituted himself
Lyle&rsquo;s escort by taking the violin, and they came
next, while Morton Rutherford and Arthur Van Dorn
brought up the rear.</p>
<p>Their two boats were already awaiting them, and Ned,
having assisted Lyle to a seat, turned to Van Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Van Dorn,&rdquo; he said in his blandest tones, &ldquo;may
we have the pleasure of your company in our boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Van Dorn laughingly accepted the invitation, Morton
Rutherford turned toward his brother, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not going to extend an invitation to me,
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Ned, with as much dignity as he
could assume, &ldquo;this boat will seat but three people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; replied his brother, with a curious downward
inflection, &ldquo;unfortunately, then, for Mr. Houston
and Miss Gladden, you will have to take the other boat,
as I am going in this one myself,&rdquo; and stepping lightly
into the boat, he pulled it quickly out into the water, leaving
Ned in a state of bewilderment, alone on shore, as
Mr. Houston and Miss Gladden were already seated in
their boat, and watching this little by-play.</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at Ned&rsquo;s expense, as he
clambered into the other boat, exclaiming good-naturedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mort, that&rsquo;s an awfully shabby trick, but then,
it&rsquo;s all I can expect of you, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all you deserve, after such attempted selfishness
on your part,&rdquo; replied his brother.</p>
<p>They rowed across the lake in the soft light, the glory
of the setting sun still reflected from the surrounding
peaks, the music of their boat songs accompanied by the
dip and plash of the oars.</p>
<p>At last they reached the cascades, and rounding a little
promontory, the glory of that wondrous scene suddenly
burst upon them. For a moment Mr. Rutherford sat
speechless, and Lyle, facing him, silently enjoyed his
surprise and his ecstasy as keenly as he enjoyed the wonderful
beauty about him. In his face, she read the same
capacity for joy or for suffering which Nature had bestowed
upon herself, and when his eyes suddenly met hers
again, he saw the tears glistening in their shining depths,
and with quick, intuitive sympathy, readily understood the
cause.</p>
<p>For a while they rowed back and forth in almost silent
admiration; then the boats were brought side by side at
the foot of the cascades, and the air resounded with song;
sometimes their voices all blending together in exquisite
harmony, then in twos and threes, while occasionally,
some beautiful old song would be given as a solo.</p>
<p>It had been an evening of rare enjoyment for each one,
and they were just about to turn their boats homeward,
when Ned Rutherford exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, don&rsquo;t let us leave this spot until Miss Maverick
sings that song she gave us the first time we came out
here, the first we ever heard her sing. I never can forget
that song, and it is always associated with this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others joined in the request. Lyle hesitated.
Could she trust herself to sing that song to-night? It
was easy to sing when love had come to another&rsquo;s heart,
but could she sing it now that he had come to her own?</p>
<p>She consented, and the oars rested once more. With
her eyes fixed on the distant mountains, Lyle began her
song:</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;Love is come with a song and a smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first words, Morton Rutherford started, and as
he fixed his eyes on the beautiful singer, her fair form and
shining hair outlined against the silvery cascades, it
seemed to him the loveliest sight of his whole life.</p>
<p>Her voice, exquisitely sweet as she began, gained in
expression and power, until she sang as she had never
sung before; and as the last notes died away, Houston,
bending his head low, whispered to Miss Gladden:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, my dear, do you think now that Lyle&rsquo;s heart
is not susceptible? She never could sing that song in
that way if she knew nothing of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Gladden made no reply, for her own heart
was too full for words.</p>
<p>The song was ended, and Lyle&rsquo;s eyes suddenly met the
dark ones fixed upon her face, and though no words were
spoken, she read in their depths that hers was not the
only heart to which love had come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>That night the diminutive lamp that did duty in the
room assigned to the two brothers burned till long past
the hour of midnight. By its dim light, Ned Rutherford indited
a letter to his fiancee, while his brother quietly
paced back and forth, the entire length of the small apartment,
his hands clasped behind him and his head thrown
back,&ndash;&ndash;his usual attitude when in deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting up another article on the application of electric
force?&rdquo; inquired Ned, as he paused to watch his
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I am thinking at present of a
force far more subtle and more powerful than that of
electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Ned in surprise, &ldquo;I thought
electricity was one of your pet hobbies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about my pet hobbies,&rdquo; said his brother,
with a smile, &ldquo;just continue your writing for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as Ned folded and sealed the voluminous
letter, and placed upon it the long, foreign address,
his brother, watching him with a curious half smile,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to give you credit for a great deal of constancy,
Ned, more than I really supposed you possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Ned, with a slight blush, &ldquo;to what
do you refer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your fidelity to your affianced,&rdquo; Morton replied,
&ldquo;under the rather adverse circumstances that attend your
suit, and notwithstanding the unusual attractions by
which you have been surrounded here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that,&rdquo; said Ned, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as
I deserve so very much credit. Houston appropriated
Miss Gladden to himself pretty soon after we came here,
and besides, she isn&rsquo;t exactly my style, after all; she
would suit Houston a great deal better than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said his brother, quietly, &ldquo;and what of the younger
lady? Perhaps she is not your style, either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I should say not,&rdquo; Ned replied, with the least
perceptible scorn in his tone, &ldquo;not but what she is a
lovely girl, and I respect her, and feel sorry for her, but
I should think one glimpse of her family would decide
that question, once for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said Morton Rutherford, pausing in his walk,
directly in front of his brother, &ldquo;is it possible that you are
so blind as not to see that Miss Maverick, as you call her,&ndash;&ndash;I
prefer to call her Lyle,&ndash;&ndash;has no connection whatever
with the family in which she lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Ned inquired, with surprise, &ldquo;I
remember Houston and Miss Gladden expressed the
same opinion when I was here before, but I don&rsquo;t think
they had any proof that such was the case, and even if it
were so, I don&rsquo;t see how it helps the matter much, for
nobody knows to what sort of a family she really does
belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said his brother, indignantly, &ldquo;I know nothing
of the opinion of Houston or Miss Gladden upon this subject,
but where are your own eyes, and where is your reason?
If you discovered one of the rarest and most beautiful
flowers known to exist in the plant world, in a heap of
tailings out here among these mines, would you immediately
conclude that, because you had found it there, it
must be indigenous to the spot? Look at that girl, and
tell me if there is one trace in feature, in form, in manner,
or in speech, of plebeian blood, and then will you
tell me that she is in any way connected with people such
as these? They are not merely plebeian, they are low, debased,
criminal. They are criminals of the deepest dye,
not only capable of any villainy, but already guilty, and
to such a degree that their guilt has made them shrinking,
skulking cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mort, if you are correct, and I don&rsquo;t say that you
are not, how does she come to be in such a place as this,
with no memory of anything different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the villainy of that man whom you pointed
out to me as her father; through his villainy, and in no
other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she was stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; I can see in his face that he has committed some
terrible crime,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps many of them,&ndash;&ndash;and he is afraid
to look a stranger in the eye; and a glance at that beautiful
girl is enough to fasten upon him one of his crimes.
She is from a family whose blood is as pure from any
taint, physical, mental, or moral, as is your own, and unless
I am greatly mistaken, she is not wholly unconscious
of this herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the younger brother, &ldquo;I
never dreamed of all this! If it is really as you think, I
only wish we could find her true home, and have her
restored to it, and make that scoundrel suffer for his
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is among the possibilities, it shall be done,&rdquo; said
Morton Rutherford, quietly, but in a tone which startled
Ned with its volume of meaning. The latter looked up
in quick surprise, a question on his lips, but he knew his
brother&rsquo;s face too well; the question was not asked, and
he only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Mort, and here&rsquo;s my hand; I&rsquo;m with
you on this, whatever you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next few days, nothing of any special import
occurred at the camp. Houston, soon after the arrival
of Morton and Ned Rutherford, had written to his uncle
that preparations were now about completed, and everything
was so nearly in readiness that he and his party had
better come out immediately to one of the western cities,
from which they could be summoned by telegraph on
short notice. Accordingly, Mr. Cameron had already
left New York, and in company with his attorney and the
English expert, was now on his way west, Mrs. Cameron
also accompanying him as far west as Chicago, where she
was to stop with friends while he went on to the mines,
as she had insisted that she would feel much happier to
be nearer her husband and Everard, so that she could
more easily reach them in the event of any trouble at the
mines.</p>
<p>Van Dorn was progressing well with his work, and the
machine would soon be ready for its trial test, though he
said he would in all probability first have to go to Silver
City, in order to have replaced one or two small but important
parts which had been broken in the long, westward
journey.</p>
<p>Lyle, in the midst of the strange happiness which had
lately come to her heart, had not forgotten her resolve
to search for the proofs, of such importance to her. On
the contrary, she had now a new and powerful incentive
which gave additional zest to her efforts, although, thus
far, they had proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>One afternoon, after having made a particularly thorough
but fruitless search, she stole quietly out of the
house, and following the little path along the shore of the
lake, soon found herself in her favorite retreat among
the rocks, a secluded place from which there was no sign
of human habitation; only the mountains in their vast
solitudes were visible, their silent grandeur more eloquent
than words. It was a spot that she had loved even
in her childhood, and which had, in later years, been her
resort for study and reflection.</p>
<p>In a brief interview with Jack, at the cabin, the previous
evening, she had told him of her increasingly distinct
recollections of her mother, of the angry words between
Maverick and his wife which she had overheard, and of
her search which she felt would yet result in her obtaining
possession of the necessary proofs of her identity.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Jack, while commending the course
which she was taking, yet seemed strangely averse to
talking much with her upon the subject. At last, as she
was leaving the cabin, he had taken her hands in his,
saying, in a strangely tender tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lyle, because I say little, you must not
think I take no interest in this affair which concerns you
so closely. I am deeply interested, more deeply than you
will probably ever know, but it is for many reasons a
painful subject to me, one full of bitter memories; but I
have one favor to ask of you, my dear child, which I
know you will grant for the sake of the memory of the
happy hours we have spent together,&ndash;&ndash;it is this; that
whatever proof you may succeed in finding, you will first
bring to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will, dear Jack,&rdquo; Lyle had replied, wondering
at his manner, &ldquo;in whom should I confide if not in
you, who have been my first and best friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he, his dark, piercing eyes looking into the depths
of her own, their gaze softened by tender affection, had
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your friend always, Lyle, remember that; none
truer or more devoted to you or your welfare; but before
long, my dear, your heart will learn, if it has not
learned already, the difference between friendship and
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With burning cheeks and tearful eyes Lyle recalled his
words, and pondered deeply on the strange bond that
seemed, in some way, to exist between his life and hers,
but the longer she tried to solve the problem, the deeper
and more obscure it seemed.</p>
<p>In the midst of her reflections, she heard a light step
upon the rocky footpath, and looking up, saw Morton
Rutherford approaching. So absorbed was he in the
study of the masses of rock about him, on which had been
traced by the finger of the centuries, in wonderful hieroglyphics,
the early history of the earth, that for a time he
was unconscious of her presence there. When he saw
her he raised his hat and came quickly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, in deep, musical tones,
&ldquo;I supposed myself alone with my own thoughts; am I
intruding? if so, send me away at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, stay, if you please,&rdquo; said Lyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he answered, seating himself on the
rocks at a little distance, &ldquo;you appeared so lost in thought
I feared my coming might annoy you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;my thoughts were too perplexing,
I was growing weary of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rutherford glanced at the surrounding mountains;
&ldquo;Were you, too, trying to fathom the mystery of the
eternal hills?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was her reply, &ldquo;I have never attempted anything
so far beyond me as that; I have found more mysteries
in every-day, human life than I could solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford was silent for a few moments, then
he said in low tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will pardon me when I say, that to me,
your own life here, under the existing circumstances and
conditions, is a mystery, one which seems capable of but
one solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would be your solution?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>He saw that she understood his meaning, and was
watching him intently, eagerly, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to reply to your question by asking one in
return. Do you not believe that your life had a beginning
elsewhere than here, and under far different conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than a belief with me, it is a certainty, and
yet, strange as it may appear to you, this knowledge has
come to me but recently, and even now, I know nothing
of what those conditions may have been, except that they
were totally unlike these that exist here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interest me very much are you willing to tell me
how you arrived at this knowledge of which you speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very briefly, and without going into details, Lyle, in
response to the magnetic sympathy of those dark eyes,
gave a vivid outline of her life, and of the vague impressions
which of late were becoming distinct recollections,
and of her hope of soon finding tangible evidence regarding
the life which was daily growing more and more of a
reality.</p>
<p>Mr. Rutherford listened with intense interest to the
strange story, and when she had finished, he said slowly,
as he took a short turn up and down the rocky path:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, I have not listened to this through mere,
idle curiosity; much as your story has interested me, it
has not surprised me, for I read the truth almost from our
first meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle gave him a smile of rare sweetness and deep significance;
&ldquo;I am glad to know that,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he asked, pausing and seating himself beside
her; &ldquo;Did you think I could fail to recognize the
soul that looked out to welcome me when I first came,
no matter amid what surroundings I found it?&rdquo; Then, as
she remained silent, he continued, his tones thrilling her
heart as no human voice had ever done before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the hour that I first met you, Lyle, life has
changed for me,&ndash;&ndash;I think perhaps it will never be quite
the same again for either of us. I know that I love you
with a love that, whether reciprocated or not, can never
die; that henceforth, you will be,&ndash;&ndash;you must be,&ndash;&ndash;a part
of my very life. Let me care for you and help you; let
me help you in your search for the home for which you
were created, and of which you are worthy; but, Lyle,
before you search any farther for that home, will you not
consent to become the queen of my home, as you are already
the queen of my heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle lifted her head proudly, though the tears glistened
on the long, golden lashes; &ldquo;Do you ask me that, here
and now, knowing nothing as yet, of what the future may
reveal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; I have no fear for the future if I but have your
love. Do you think that, perhaps, in the days to come,
amid other and different surroundings, you might find
some one whose love your heart would choose in preference
to mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Lyle, impulsively, turning with outstretched
arms to him, &ldquo;You are the only one I have
ever loved,&ndash;&ndash;the only one I could ever love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is enough for me,&rdquo; he replied, drawing her
closely to his breast; &ldquo;you have come forth from the
years of the wretched past, with a soul star-white and
shining, and I have no fears for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the little group of friends assembled that evening,
it was not long before some one discovered that a
small diamond ring, of exquisite, antique design, which
Morton Rutherford had worn, had, in some manner, become
transferred to Lyle&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Wear this, for the
present,&rdquo; he had said, in taking it from his own hand,
&ldquo;until I can obtain a costlier one for you,&rdquo; but Lyle had
insisted that once placed upon her hand, there it must remain,
as she would prize it far above any other which
money could buy; and such had been the final decision.</p>
<p>When this significant fact had been discovered by one
of the little company, the intelligence was speedily telegraphed
to the rest, and Morton and Lyle soon found
themselves the recipients of hearty and affectionate congratulations
from the others.</p>
<p>The astonishment depicted on Ned&rsquo;s face, when he
comprehended the turn affairs had taken, was beyond
description, but in the little excitement which prevailed
for a few moments, it passed unnoticed, so that he had
sufficiently recovered himself to join very gracefully in
the general congratulations when his turn came.</p>
<p>A few hours later, however, as he went out for a stroll
with Van Dorn, while his brother and Houston started
out in the direction of Jack&rsquo;s cabin, his astonishment
found expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! but I never was so dumfounded in my
life! I tell you what, Van, I believe people lose their wits
when they are in love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On whose experience do you base your highly original
remark, your brother&rsquo;s or your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, both, and lots of others besides. I never yet
saw a person who was in love that didn&rsquo;t act just the
reverse of what you would expect, or of what they would
under ordinary circumstances. Now, look at us two, for
instance. Look at me! Everybody calls me rash and
impetuous, and Mort is always lecturing me for it, and
it&rsquo;s always my way to rush head-first into anything that
comes along, and here I&rsquo;ve been making love, in the regular,
orthodox fashion, to a girl I&rsquo;ve known ever since I
wore knickerbockers, and playing propriety and all that
to my prospective father-in-law; and now see Mort! the
most precise, deliberate fellow you ever saw, never says or
does anything that isn&rsquo;t exactly suited to the occasion,
you know; and here he goes and tumbles head over heels
in love with a pretty girl the first time he sees her, and
when he doesn&rsquo;t know a blessed thing about her, and, by
George! engages himself to her before he&rsquo;s known her a
week! If that isn&rsquo;t a case of clear-gone lunacy, then I
never saw one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn laughed; &ldquo;Well, of the two, I should prefer
your brother&rsquo;s form of lunacy to yours; if I ever was to
be in love, I should want the misery over as quickly as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Houston and his friend, having made a brief call at
the cabin, rose to take their leave, the former observed
Jack watching Rutherford&rsquo;s face with a degree of interest
unusual for him to manifest in a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you and my friend, Rutherford, to know each
other the little time he will be here,&rdquo; he said, addressing
Jack, &ldquo;for though I have never known what it was to have
a brother in reality, he seems to me to more nearly fill that
position than any one I have known, and I have told him
of your kindness and assistance, and the strange bond
that has seemed to unite us from the first, though we met
as strangers, so he naturally wishes to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a peculiar quiver of the lips under the heavy,
black beard, as Jack replied, in deep, full tones, &ldquo;Mr.
Rutherford&rsquo;s face carries with it its own recommendation,
and the fact that he is as a brother to yourself will insure
him a double welcome here as often as he pleases to come
during his stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston passed onward into the outer room, pausing
to chat with Mike, while Morton Rutherford lingered,
and extending his hand to Jack, said in low tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another reason for wishing to meet you. From
what Lyle has told me, I know you to have been, until
very recently, her only friend, and to you, as to her friend,
and perhaps, in one sense, her guardian, I wish to state
that I love her, and have been so fortunate as to win her
love in return; and that I hope before very long, my
home will be hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Jack responded, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! has she already told you?&rdquo; Rutherford asked
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only unconsciously; but I read soon after your coming,
that her heart was no longer her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then grasping Rutherford&rsquo;s hand warmly, he added, in
tones vibrating with some deep emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have chosen better than you know. I believe
I can trust her and her happiness in your hands. God
bless you both! and may He bless you in proportion to
your love and fidelity toward her!&rdquo;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIX' id='CHAPTER_XXXIX'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>The following day, Mr. Blaisdell suddenly made his appearance
at the camp, accompanied by Mr. Rivers and a
mining expert who had come out in the interests of a
Chicago firm, looking for good paying investments.
Houston had received no word of their coming, and the
first intimation which he had of their arrival was the sight
of the three gentlemen, as he approached the house at
dinner time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Houston?&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, pausing
in his walk up and down before the house, and extending
his hand, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the work progressing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finely,&rdquo; replied Houston, &ldquo;the output is steadily increasing,
week by week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeps you pretty busy, I suppose? Well, I hope we
can give you a little help before long; we&rsquo;ve located Barden
at last, and he starts for the west next week. Let
me introduce you to Mr. Parsons, a mining expert from
Chicago; Mr. Parsons, this is Mr. Houston, our general
superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston exchanged greetings with the stranger, and
with Mr. Rivers, the latter watching him closely, though
saying very little.</p>
<p>Dinner was served as quickly as possible, as Mr. Parsons
was limited for time, and was to return to Silver City
on the evening train. Most of the conversation at the
table was on mines and mining, Mr. Blaisdell trying to
impress each one present, Mr. Parsons in particular, with
his extensive knowledge, both theoretical and practical,
on all that pertained to the subject, as well as with a sense
of the immense value of the properties owned by the
company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. W. E. Cameron, of New York, owns some very
valuable mines out here, I understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Parsons
casually, his innocent remark producing rather a startling
effect upon the minds of his listeners, though they, one
and all, succeeded in preserving a calm exterior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has an interest in some very fine properties,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Blaisdell blandly, though with a visible contracting
of the muscles about the mouth, &ldquo;you are acquainted
with Mr. Cameron, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, on the contrary, I never even met the gentleman,
but he is extensively known among the leading
business houses of Chicago, and he was pointed out to
me, the day I came away, as the owner of some of the
finest mines in this locality,&rdquo; Mr. Parsons explained,
thereby carrying consternation to the heart of every one
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say that Mr. Cameron was in
Chicago?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Blaisdell, while Mr. Rivers&rsquo; restless
eyes were at once on the alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, he was there the day I left; at least, a
gentleman with whom I happened to be talking about
western investments, pointed him out to me, and cited
him as the owner of western properties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, did you hear anything said as to whether he
was coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing whatever, except what I have
stated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, speaking for the first
time, and in his quick, incisive way; he feared Mr. Blaisdell
had betrayed his anxiety; &ldquo;all right, only we would
like to know his whereabouts, as it will be necessary to
wire him in a day or two, regarding some ore shipments.
Can you give us the hotel where he was stopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry that I cannot oblige you, but I have
not the least idea where he was located; I simply saw
him passing on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of no consequence,&rdquo; replied Mr. Blaisdell, with
assumed indifference, &ldquo;we can of course ascertain his
present address from the New York house; it will take a
little more time, that is all. We had better proceed to
the mines at once, if Mr. Parsons is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had left and Haight was on his way to the
mills, the four young men held a few moments&rsquo; consultation
outside the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jingo!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned Rutherford, &ldquo;it looks as
though old Buncombe was going to get on to our surprise
party that we&rsquo;re planning for him! What are you
fellows going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Van Dorn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether this
is going to interfere with our arrangements or not; what
do you think, Everard? will the company &lsquo;smell a rat&rsquo;
anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are evidently alarmed at the possibility of Mr.
Cameron&rsquo;s coming out here, but there is nothing yet to
arouse their suspicions against us, so I do not think it
will interfere materially with our plans at present. They
will be able to learn nothing of my uncle&rsquo;s movements
from the New York house, as he will have forestalled
them there. He had but just reached Chicago when this
Parsons left, and as he and Mr. Whitney wished, if possible,
to remain there a few days, to consult with a legal
firm who are personal friends of theirs, I think it best, in
case this company remains quiet, to take no action yet
for two or three days; but if the officers of the company
begin to appear suspicious, or as if they were trying to
cover their tracks, the sooner we telegraph for our party,
the better; get them here as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will be best,&rdquo; said Morton Rutherford, &ldquo;if
their suspicions are aroused, we cannot be too expeditious,
for they will be desperate when they find themselves
cornered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hold ourselves in readiness to act promptly,&rdquo;
Houston added, &ldquo;probably within twenty-four hours we
will be able to decide which course to pursue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston went to his work determined to keep a close
watch on the movements of Blaisdell and Rivers. A
couple of hours later, however, the three men entered the
mill where he was engaged superintending the weighing
of some ore; Mr. Rivers went at once to Haight&rsquo;s little
private office, while Blaisdell approached him with the
expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just take Mr. Parsons
through the mills and entertain him for the next half
hour. Mr. Rivers and myself will be engaged about that
length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston complied with the request, and in a very short
time discovered that Mr. Parsons&rsquo; knowledge of metallurgy
and mineralogy was exceedingly limited, but that in
exact proportion to his own ignorance, he had been profoundly
impressed by the knowledge which Mr. Blaisdell
had aired for his especial benefit, and the parrot-like way
in which he repeated some of the expressions which Mr.
Blaisdell kept as his &ldquo;stock in trade,&rdquo; was very amusing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Houston was deeply interested in the private
meeting held in Haight&rsquo;s little dingy room, as he
felt certain that some issues were being discussed and decisions
reached that would, in their results, be of the
greatest importance to him, and he awaited the reappearance
of the general manager and secretary with considerable
expectancy.</p>
<p>He was not disappointed; a glance at their faces revealed
that the subjects under discussion had not been
pleasant. Mr. Blaisdell&rsquo;s face was white, and set in hard,
determined lines, while that of his companion was flushed
with anger, and his cunning, crafty eyes were full of suspicion,
as they glanced repeatedly in Houston&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parsons,&rdquo; said Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;we will have to ask
you to excuse Mr. Houston, as we have a little business
with him, and if you will step over there in the office and
sit down, we will have completed our business in half or
three-quarters of an hour; by that time the team will be
here, in readiness to take us to the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments of desultory conversation about
the work which Houston knew to be only preliminary,
during which Mr. Rivers moved about in a nervous,
restless manner, Mr. Blaisdell said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston, we hear some rather strange reports
concerning your conduct lately; your actions have certainly
been highly censurable, and the least that can be
said is that you have exceeded your authority here in a
very marked degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what respect have I exceeded my authority?&rdquo; demanded
Houston, folding his arms, with an expression
on his face that made the general manager regret that
he had begun the encounter; but it was too late to retreat,
besides, Rivers was watching him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your manner of discharging the duties assigned to
you; you have taken advantage of your position in the
most reprehensible and unworthy way, and have overstepped
the bounds when you had no right whatever to
do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to ask you to be a little more explicit,
Mr. Blaisdell,&rdquo; Houston replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come to the point, Blaisdell?&rdquo; said
Rivers impatiently. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of beating about
the bush? The long and the short of it is just this,&rdquo; he
added, turning to Houston, &ldquo;you have been taking upon
yourself what did not concern you, prying around, late at
night, in mines with which you had nothing whatever to
do, in company with miners who had no more business
there than you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what mine do you refer?&rdquo; asked Houston, with exasperating
persistency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the Lucky Chance, and you know it,&rdquo; retorted
Rivers angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rivers,&rdquo; said Houston, in a tone that Blaisdell
had heard on a former occasion, and with a steel-like
glitter in his eyes that was anything but attractive to
either of the gentlemen present; &ldquo;Mr. Blaisdell knows, if
you do not, that since my first coming here, whatever
kind of work has been assigned to me, I have thoroughly
familiarized myself with it. When I was given charge of
these mines I had reason to suppose that each and every
mine owned by the company was included under my supervision,
and if there were any which the officers of the
company, for reasons of their own, wished excluded from
such supervision, it was their business so to inform me. I
have not been so informed. Mr. Blaisdell himself took
me into that mine, and nothing was said to lead me to
suppose that that mine was any exception to those placed
in my charge, and your informant, if he chose so to do,
could tell you that I have inspected in like manner each
and every mine under my supervision, taking with me
one or both of the same men, when the mine happened
to be one with which I was not familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His intentions were all right,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Blaisdell,
&ldquo;he was over-zealous, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intentions be damned!&rdquo; said Mr. Rivers, angrily, &ldquo;he
was altogether too officious, and I won&rsquo;t have it; people
in my employ have to know their place and keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Houston, in cutting tones,
&ldquo;but I will not ask you, Mr. Rivers, or any one connected
with this company, to tell me my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Rivers in a rage, &ldquo;let me tell you,
young man, it is to your interest to be a little careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; answered Houston scornfully; &ldquo;Mr. Rivers,&rdquo;
he added, advancing toward that gentleman, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
you discharge me? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be to your interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers saw he had gone too far; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered
quickly, though sullenly, &ldquo;we have said nothing
about discharging you; you are too efficient a man for us
to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Houston,&rdquo; added Mr. Blaisdell, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t
think of discharging you, you&rsquo;re too good a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not too good a man,&rdquo; replied Houston, facing
them both with a look which they understood; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
discharge me simply because,&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t dare to!&rdquo; and
he emphasized the last words with a heavy blow upon a
rude desk standing near.</p>
<p>Blaisdell and Rivers exchanged glances, and for a moment
were speechless. The former was the first to recover
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Houston,&rdquo; he said, in a conciliatory tone, &ldquo;we
won&rsquo;t have any more words; we all understand one another
pretty well, and there&rsquo;ll be no more complaints or
trouble. You go on pretty much as you have done, and
it will be all right. It&rsquo;s time we were getting back now,
but I&rsquo;ll be out here next week with Barden, and we&rsquo;ll fix
things up satisfactory all &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he get here?&rdquo; asked Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latter part of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston thought an instant, his party would be there
the first or middle of the week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I tender my resignation now,
to take effect when he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Houston, no indeed, why, we couldn&rsquo;t think
of such a thing,&rdquo; said Blaisdell, really alarmed, while Rivers
maintained a sullen silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not particularly anxious to hold this position, I
can assure you; there is very little in it but hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, well, you stay by us a while longer, and
we&rsquo;ll take you into the company yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;it would be no use taking me
into the company, I wouldn&rsquo;t know my place, or keep it,&rdquo;
and with that parting shot, he turned and left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blaisdell,&rdquo; said Rivers, his face relaxing for a moment
into a grim smile, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as I told you, your smart
young man is too smart for you. It&rsquo;s my opinion we&rsquo;ve
caught a tartar;&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;re afraid to keep him, and we don&rsquo;t
dare let him go.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Houston, on the following morning, in the execution
of his daily round of duties, happened to be passing
the Yankee Boy mine, his attention was arrested by a
quantity of powder deposited near the mouth of the shaft,
which the workmen were preparing to take below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he inquired sternly.
&ldquo;Who has given any orders for this powder to be brought
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them was the boss&rsquo;s orders, sir,&rdquo; replied one of the
men, respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boss? whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, sir, I meant the boss as was up
here yisterday; Mr. Haight, he told me this morning as
these was the orders he give him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haight,&rdquo; said Houston, as, a few moments later, he
entered the office of that individual, &ldquo;did Mr. Blaisdell
leave orders yesterday for powder to be taken over to the
Yankee Boy mines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Haight, with his usual smile, &ldquo;and I intended
to have spoken to you about it this morning, but
I forgot it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his object? any blasting to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had quite a long consultation together yesterday,
he and Rivers and I, and we decided that it would
pay to do some extensive drifting in those mines, and a
good deal of that rock will have to be blasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon is this blasting to begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say exactly, just how soon, probably
within the next seven or eight days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what direction is the drifting to extend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haight looked slightly surprised but replied: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
a little undecided about that, just what course to take;
Rivers was for one thing, and Blaisdell and I for another.
After they have blasted a ways, we can tell something
from the character of the rock in what direction it will be
best to run the drift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few more questions, some of which Haight did
not answer so readily as might have been expected,
Houston left him. He did not proceed at once to the
building where Van Dorn was at work, but first returned
to the mines, where he discovered that the powder was
not only being stored in the Yankee Boy group, but also
in the Lucky Chance, and one or two others of the surrounding
mines. A little later he made an errand to that
part of the mills where Van Dorn was to be found, and
quietly calling him to one side, related to him what he
had discovered, and his talk with Haight.</p>
<p>Van Dorn was more familiar with mines, their methods
of operation, and the rules governing their underground
workings, than Houston, and he immediately exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! that fellow is a fool, Everard, or else he
was simply &lsquo;stuffing&rsquo; you; to drift in the direction he mentioned
would be a useless expenditure of time and money,
there would be nothing in it, it is utterly absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mistrusted as much,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;and I have my
own opinion as to the meaning of all this, but I wished
to get your idea of the matter. What do you think of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; said Van Dorn slowly, &ldquo;as though
they were making preparations to blow up these mines,
at a moment&rsquo;s warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;was just the conviction that
forced itself upon my mind when I saw that powder,
though I will admit I had never once thought of their resorting
to such measures as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the only thing left for them to do, by
George! after the shape in which they have got things;
their idea probably would be, in the event of Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s
coming, to destroy in this way all the evidence, as
they think, existing against them. It shows pretty conclusively
that they have no suspicions of us, for if they
knew the evidence in our possession they would blow us
up rather than the mines. You will telegraph at once for
Mr. Cameron, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once; we must get him here as quickly and as
quietly as we can; before they put their plans into action,
if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the thing to do; they probably will take no
action unless they hear of his coming. We ought to get
a dispatch off before night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; Houston replied, with quiet decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you manage it? It will look rather suspicious
for you or me to leave our work and go down to the
Y with a message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Morton our dispatch and cipher book, and he
will attend to it better than you or I, for he is an expert
operator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! that&rsquo;s so, I had forgotten it; he learned
telegraphy there at college just to amuse himself, and had
a battery in his room; well, that&rsquo;s fortunate, he will be
just the one for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly noon,&rdquo; said Houston, consulting his watch,
&ldquo;we will see Morton at the house, and arrange the message
between us, and he will send it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner, there was a brief consultation in Houston&rsquo;s
room with the result that the following dispatch
was formulated, written in cipher, and addressed to Mr.
Whitney, at Chicago, the attorney from New York, accompanying
Mr. Cameron:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Come at once, no delay; go to Arlington Hotel, Silver
City; keep dark, do not register. Van Dorn will meet you at
hotel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Houston realized that they were now rapidly approaching
the final denouement,&ndash;&ndash;the closing act of the drama
which might yet prove a tragedy,&ndash;&ndash;and as he placed the
folded slip of paper in Morton Rutherford&rsquo;s hand, he
said with a sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the beginning of the end.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_XLI' id='CHAPTER_XLI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
</div>
<p>As Morton Rutherford&rsquo;s fingers touched the key of the
little instrument that was to send forth that fateful message,
it was the unconscious touching of a secret spring
which was to set in motion a succession of events of which
he little dreamed.</p>
<p>He remained at the station until the answer came back
over the wires:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Leave Chicago to-night; will follow instructions to the letter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was on Saturday. On Tuesday the expected party
would reach Silver City, where they were to be met by
Van Dorn, who would furnish them all details and accompany
them on the evening train to the Y, from which
point Houston and Morton Rutherford would convey
them by team to the mining camp.</p>
<p>From Saturday until Tuesday only! but those intervening
days were full of a strange excitement for the little
group of friends who were in the secret, and there was
that constant sense of expectancy, combined with an
alert watchfulness, which kept the nerves tense and rigid,
and rendered the mind unusually clear and active.</p>
<p>On Monday, Van Dorn left for Silver City, his errand
ostensibly being to replace the broken portions of the machinery,
now nearly finished, which were necessary for
its completion.</p>
<p>All felt that the climax to which they had looked forward
was now very near, and Lyle, who perhaps realized
the situation the most keenly of any, was restless and excited,
something very unusual for her.</p>
<p>Her search, thus far unsuccessful, had not been abandoned,
and as she sat in the little porch on that particular
afternoon, idle because she could not fix her attention
upon book or work, it seemed as if the years of her early
life among the mountains stood out with more than usual
distinctness. Among other trifling objects, there was
suddenly recalled to her memory a box which used always
to stand in Mrs. Maverick&rsquo;s little bed-room, and
which had looked wonderfully attractive to her childish
eyes on account of a flowered red and green paper with
which it was covered. Once, overcome with infantile
curiosity, she had tried to open it, and had received a severe
whipping therefor. She could remember it very distinctly
now, a box about eighteen inches square, with no
fastening, but always securely tied with a stout cord.
Late years it had been removed to the little attic and she
had forgotten it. Where was it now? She had not seen
it for months, or was it years? What could it have contained?</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was occupied with a new magazine.
Morton and Ned Rutherford had gone out for a stroll
among the rocks. Quietly Lyle slipped up-stairs, and going
to the dark, dusty attic, began searching for the object
so suddenly recalled to mind.</p>
<p>She could find no trace of it, however, and had about
concluded that it must have been destroyed, when her attention
was arrested by a pile of old clothing and rubbish
on the floor in a particularly dark corner, behind
some large boxes. A slight examination revealed that
there was some solid substance underneath. Hastily
overturning the rubbish, her eyes descried in the dim
light the identical red and green papered box familiar to
her childhood.</p>
<p>With an exclamation of joy she dragged it forth from
its hiding place, and going over to the one tiny window,
covered with dust and cobwebs, she sat down with the
newly found treasure, first arranging a pile of old bedding
as a screen between herself and the door, to preclude all
possibility of her whereabouts being discovered.</p>
<p>With fingers trembling with excitement, she undid the
fastenings of the heavy cord and slowly lifted the cover,
not knowing exactly what she expected or hoped to find,
but certain that the key for which she had searched was
close at hand.</p>
<p>Within the box lay a large parcel wrapped in a newspaper,
worn and yellow with age, and pinned to the parcel
was a letter, addressed in a cramped, almost illegible
hand:</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;To Lyle,<br />
to be read after my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle recognized the writing,&ndash;&ndash;it was Mrs. Maverick&rsquo;s,
whose educational advantages, though exceedingly limited,
were yet superior to those of her husband, in that
she could read and write, though she had little idea of the
rules of grammar or orthography.</p>
<p>Lyle unpinned the letter and turned it over curiously
in her hands for a moment; then she laid it aside, saying
to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will first see what this package contains, and will
probably open that later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted the parcel and began removing the paper
wrappings, which burst like tissue and dropped in pieces,
leaving a mass of fine cambric and dainty laces and embroideries,
from which was exhaled a perfume, faint and
subtle, and yet which recalled to Lyle so vividly the memories
of that long-ago forgotten time, that she seemed
like one awakening from a long oblivion to the scenes of
a once familiar life. For a moment, she grew faint and
dizzy, and, closing her eyes, leaned against the wall for
support, while she tried to grasp the vision that seemed
just ready to open up before her. But it passed, and with
a sigh she opened her eyes, her gaze falling on the contents
of the package which had fallen open.</p>
<p>She saw the dress of a little child,&ndash;&ndash;apparently about
two years of age,&ndash;&ndash;a marvelous creation of the finest of
white linen and the daintiest of embroideries; lying within
it was a broad sash of blue silk, neatly folded together,
a pair of tiny, blue silk stockings, and little kid shoes of
the same delicate shade; but the shoes and sash, as well
as the dress, were soiled and blackened as if they had
come in contact with charred wood.</p>
<p>The dress and the little undergarments each and all
bore the initials &ldquo;M. L. W.,&rdquo; and Lyle pondered over
them with wondering eyes, while handling with reverent
touch these relics of her childhood,&ndash;&ndash;a childhood which
she could not recall.</p>
<p>As she unrolled the blue sash, there dropped from within
its folds a small, pasteboard box, which she hastily
opened, exposing to view a tiny gold locket and chain of
rare workmanship and exquisite design. Upon touching
a little spring, it opened, and Lyle gave a low cry of delight,
for there was revealed the same beautiful face which
she had seen in Jack&rsquo;s cabin,&ndash;&ndash;the face of her mother.
For some time she gazed at it through fast-gathering
tears, then happening to note the engraving on the inside
of the case, opposite to the picture, she held it closer to
the light, to discern the delicate characters of the inscription,
and read:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;To Marjorie Lyle Washburn,<br />
Upon her second birthday.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Lyle Maverick no longer, but Marjorie Lyle Washburn!
She repeated the name over and over to herself,&ndash;&ndash;the
magic talisman by which she was to find the home and
friends she sought!</p>
<p>Kissing the locket reverently, she replaced it in the
box, and folding together the little garments, she again
took up the letter. She studied it for a moment, then
resolutely breaking the seal, began to read its contents.
It was slow work, for the writing in many places was so
poor as to be nearly illegible, but, with burning cheeks
and eyes flashing with indignation at what it revealed,
she read it to the end.</p>
<p>In uncouth phrases and illiterate language, and yet
with a certain pathos, Mrs. Maverick told the story of
the death, years before, while their home was east, in
Ohio, of her own little girl between two and three years
of age, and her inconsolable sorrow. A few months afterward,
Jim had suddenly returned from a neighboring
town where he was working, bringing with him a beautiful
little girl of the same age as her own, but unusually
advanced for her years, whose father and mother he
claimed had been killed in a railroad accident, and of
whose friends nothing could be learned. His wife had
accepted his story in good faith, and welcomed the motherless
little one to her own lonely heart. Unknown to
Jim, who had charged her to burn them, she had also
preserved the garments worn by the little stranger on
that day.</p>
<p>But the little one did not take kindly to her new surroundings
but cried piteously for her mother, night and
day, even refusing food of all kinds, until she was suddenly
taken with a strange illness which lasted for many
weeks. When she finally recovered, all memory of her
former life seemed to have been completely blotted out
of her mind, and she no longer called for her mother, except
occasionally in her sleep. Very soon after they had
come out to the mines, and nothing of any importance
occurred until Lyle was about seven years old.</p>
<p>At that time, Jim had suddenly made his appearance at
the house one day, appearing both angry and frightened,
and had ordered his wife to keep Lyle locked up, on pretext
of punishing her, until he gave permission for her
release. He would give no explanation, and by his curses
and threats compelled her to obey.</p>
<p>That day, a fine-looking, elderly gentleman, who had
just arrived from the east to purchase some mining property,
came to the house for dinner, and took his meals
there for the two days following, during which time, Lyle
was not allowed her liberty. Not until nearly a year later
did Mrs. Maverick learn that the eastern stranger, whose
coming had so terrified Maverick, was Lyle&rsquo;s grandfather.
Jim then confessed that he had taken the child from the
wreck where its mother had lost her life, and brought her
west with him, knowing whose child she was, and keeping
her out of revenge for some wrong which he claimed
this man had done him years before.</p>
<p>In vain his wife urged to have the child returned to her
rightful home; he threatened her life if she ever breathed
the secret to any living soul. A sense of guilt made her
unhappy for a time, but as years passed she grew more
indifferent to it, and as she saw, more and more, how utterly
unlike any of her own family Lyle was growing, she
no longer cared for her as she had done, though she tried
to treat her kindly. Jim&rsquo;s hatred of Lyle seemed to increase
with every year, until his wife sometimes feared
that he would resort to personal violence.</p>
<p>As she found her own health and strength failing she
began to reflect upon the terrible position in which Lyle
would find herself in case of her own death, left alone with
Maverick and his two sons, and to save her from such a
fate, she had resolved to write this letter, acquainting Lyle
with her own history so far as she was able to give it.</p>
<p>At the close she begged Lyle not to think too harshly
of her or consider that she was altogether to blame in
this matter, and expressed the wish that she might some
day find her own friends from whom she had been taken.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe Lyle&rsquo;s emotions as
she finished the perusal of this strange letter; joy that
she had finally found the evidence she sought, and an intense
longing to see those from whom she had been so
cruelly separated all these years, mingled with a fearful
apprehension lest this knowledge might have come too
late, when those whose affection she would claim, might
have already passed beyond the limits of finite, human
love, into the love infinite and eternal. And deep in her
heart burned indignation, fierce and strong, against the
one who had wrought all this wretchedness,&ndash;&ndash;carrying
additional sorrow to a home already bereaved, robbing
her of the love that was rightfully hers and of the dower
of a happy childhood which could never be restored,&ndash;&ndash;all
to gratify his cowardly revenge!</p>
<p>In the midst of these reflections, Lyle suddenly recalled
the promise she had given Jack that he should be
the first to learn of her success. It was now time for
him to be at the cabin and she would have an opportunity
to see him before the return of the others to the house.
Accordingly, she restored the empty box to its hiding
place, and having concealed the most of its contents in
her own room, started forth on her joyful errand, taking
with her the tiny locket and the letter.</p>
<p>As she approached the cabin she saw Jack sitting with
Rex in the door-way and knew that he was alone. Jack,
to whom her face was an open book, read the tidings
which she had brought before they had exchanged a
word. He rose to meet her, and looking into her radiant
face, he said in gentle tones and with a grave smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have good news! Have you found what you
hoped to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and you who have shared all
my troubles must be the first sharer of my joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they entered the cabin, and seated in the
little, familiar room, Lyle told the story of her discovery,
and opening the locket, placed it in Jack&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>For a moment he gazed silently at the little trinket,
then he said in low tones, as if half to himself, &ldquo;It is she,
and you are her child, as I have always believed,&rdquo; then
added, &ldquo;I rejoice with you, Lyle, I am glad for your
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke, Lyle, notwithstanding the exuberance
of her own joy, could not fail to observe in his
face indications of poignant pain, as he looked at the
lovely pictured face, and as she repeated the name inscribed
opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;have I made you
suffer by my thoughtlessness? Forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; he answered tenderly, &ldquo;you have caused
me no pain; if I suffer, it is on account of bitter memories
of which you as yet know nothing, and I pray you
may never know. What letter have you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle read the letter, Jack silently pacing up and down
the room, listening, with a look of intense indignation
deepening on his face, until she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I have suspected all these years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
dastardly villain! the scoundrel! Thank God, it is not
yet too late, there are those who can and will right the
wrong, so far as it is possible to right it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Lyle&rsquo;s request, they compared the picture with the
photograph in Jack&rsquo;s possession; they were one and the
same, except that the latter had been taken a few years
earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said Lyle earnestly, &ldquo;can you tell me anything
about my relatives? Are my grandparents living? and had
my parents brothers or sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned quite recently that your grandparents
are still living,&rdquo; Jack answered slowly, after a pause, &ldquo;as
to the others I cannot say; even of your own mother I
can trust myself to say but very little, it is too painful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you advise me to do now?&rdquo; Lyle asked
wistfully, but with slight hesitation. &ldquo;What would be the
best course for me to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an expression unlike anything she had ever seen
on his face, and a depth of pathos in his voice she had
never heard, he replied very tenderly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can no longer advise you, my dear Lyle; take these
proofs which you have found to Everard Houston; he
can advise you now far better than I; show them to him,
my dear, and you will have no further need of counsel
or help from me, much as I wish it were in my power
to give both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Houston?&rdquo; Lyle had risen in her surprise,
and stood regarding Jack with tearful, perplexed astonishment;
there was a hidden significance in his words
which as yet she could not fathom. &ldquo;I do not understand
you, Jack; why do you speak as though you could no
more be to me the friend and counselor that you have
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled one of his rare, sweet smiles. &ldquo;Do as I have
suggested, dear,&ndash;&ndash;then you will understand; and I shall
want to see you for a few moments again to-night, after
you have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat reassured by his smile, and yet perplexed
by his manner, Lyle left the cabin and slowly returned
to the house, everything about her seeming unreal, as
though she were walking in a dream.</p>
<p>Miss Gladden was chatting with Morton and Ned
Rutherford, and in reply to Lyle&rsquo;s question whether Mr.
Houston had returned, stated that he was in his room,
having just come up from the mines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will see him just a moment,&rdquo; Lyle responded,
passing into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not heard any bad news, have you?&rdquo; asked
Miss Gladden apprehensively, noting the peculiar expression
on Lyle&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the latter answered with a smile, &ldquo;it is about
nothing regarding himself that I wish to see him, only
something concerning myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door stood open into Houston&rsquo;s room, and Lyle
could see him standing by the table, arranging some
papers which he proceeded to sort and tie up in separate
parcels.</p>
<p>In response to her light knock he glanced quickly
around, and observing her unusual expression, advanced
to meet her, thinking, as did Miss Gladden, that possibly
she had heard something appertaining to the present
situation of affairs at the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Lyle, come in; you look as though
you were the bearer of important news of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have news,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;though of importance
only to myself; I need a little counsel, and was told to
come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Lyle, I will only be too glad to give you
any advice, or render any assistance within my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she answered, at the same time producing
the little box and the letter. &ldquo;Leslie has probably
told you of the manner in which I learned that the proofs
as to my true parentage and my own identity existed
within this house, and of my search for them since that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston bowed in assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;my search proved successful,
in so far as that I have discovered my own name,
and also the proofs that I was stolen by that villain, Maverick,
in a spirit of retaliation and revenge; but I have
as yet no knowledge as to who or where my friends may
be. Naturally, I took these proofs to Jack, and asked
his advice as to the best course to pursue, and he has
sent me to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more than glad to hear this, my dear Lyle,&rdquo; responded
Houston cordially; &ldquo;I have always felt a great
interest in you, and it will give me much pleasure if I
can assist you in finding your friends, and I shall appreciate
it highly if Jack has intrusted me with this responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the locket from the box, Lyle handed it, unopen,
to Houston, saying as she did so, &ldquo;This is the only
clue I have by which to find my friends; it contains my
mother&rsquo;s picture, and my own name,&ndash;&ndash;Marjorie Lyle
Washburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washburn!&rdquo; exclaimed Houston in surprise, pausing
as he was about to open the locket. &ldquo;Washburn! Marjorie
Washburn! That sounds familiar, both those names
occur in my uncle&rsquo;s family, his wife and his daughter,&ndash;&ndash;ah,
I recall it now, that was the name of my cousin&rsquo;s little
daughter. Strange!&ndash;&ndash;what! what is this?&rdquo; He had
opened the locket and was gazing in astonishment at
the beautiful face. &ldquo;This,&ndash;&ndash;this is her picture, the picture
of my cousin, Edna Cameron Washburn! What is
the meaning of this?&rdquo; And, unable to say anything further,
he looked to Lyle for an explanation.</p>
<p>She, too, was nearly speechless with astonishment.
&ldquo;What did you say was her name?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>Houston repeated the name, while a strange light began
to dawn in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was my mother,&rdquo; Lyle said simply. She could
say nothing more, the walls of the little room seemed to
be whirling rapidly about her, and she could see nothing
distinctly.</p>
<p>Faintly, as though sounding far in the distance, she
heard Houston&rsquo;s voice as he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible? and yet, you resemble her! Why
have I never thought of it before? She had a little daughter
Marjorie, whom we always supposed was killed in the
wreck in which her own life was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Lyle, holding out the letter, but
speaking with great effort, for the room was growing
very dark, and a strange numbness seemed stealing over
heart and brain, &ldquo;this tells that I was stolen from the
side of my dead mother who was killed in a wreck&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She could get no farther, and she knew nothing of his
reply. A thick darkness seemed to envelop her, fast shutting
out all sense even of life itself. There was a sound
for an instant like the deafening roar of waters surging
about her, and then she seemed sinking down, down
into infinite depths, until she lost all consciousness. For
the first time in her life she had fainted.</p>
<p>Houston caught her as she was falling, and a moment
later the little group outside were startled by his sudden
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie,&rdquo; he said, in quick, low tones, &ldquo;you and Morton
come to my room. Lyle has fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Everard?&rdquo; asked Ned, springing
to his feet. &ldquo;Anything serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; was Houston&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Her fainting
was the result of over-excitement. Come into my room,
Ned, when she has revived, I think I have made a discovery
in which we will all be interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he returned Lyle was beginning to revive,
though unable to speak, and leaving her in the care of
Leslie and Morton for a few moments, Houston hastily
scanned the letter which Lyle had given him, soon reading
enough of its contents here and there to get a correct
idea of the whole.</p>
<p>Both Miss Gladden and Morton Rutherford realized
that something had transpired out of the usual order
of events. Each believed it connected with some discovery
relating to Lyle&rsquo;s early history, but of what
nature the discovery might be they had no clue.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able to speak Houston was at her
side, and she read in his face the confirmation of the
truth which had dawned upon her mind as he had repeated
her mother&rsquo;s name, but which had seemed to her
past belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really true, and I have not been dreaming?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most certainly true, my dear Lyle,&rdquo; Houston replied,
&ldquo;and I am very glad to find that you, who have
seemed to me like a sister from our first acquaintance,
will soon be my sister in reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stooping, he kissed her on the forehead, and then in
reply to the glances of astonishment on the part of the
others, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leslie, I will have to prepare you for a double surprise,
and since we four are now members of one family,
I can speak here without reserve. When I first won
your love, my dear, it was as the salaried clerk of a disreputable
mining company. I was old-fashioned enough
to wish to win your love with love, to feel assured that
you cared for me for my own sake. Lately, you have
known that I was the representative of Mr. Cameron,
of New York, but you did not know that I was Mr.
Cameron&rsquo;s nephew and adopted son,&ndash;&ndash;his son in all respects,
excepting that I have not taken his name.&rdquo; He
paused a moment, and laid his hand affectionately on
Lyle&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I now have a pleasant surprise for
you both. I wish to introduce you to Marjorie Lyle
Washburn, my cousin and my adopted sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a burst of tears, Miss Gladden knelt beside Lyle,
throwing her arms about her neck, while Lyle whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Leslie, you have been like a sister to me in
my poverty and loneliness. I am glad we will not be
separated in the life of love and happiness that awaits
me. We will be sisters still, more closely united than
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to Morton Rutherford, whose emotion seemed
nearly as deep as Miss Gladden&rsquo;s, Houston said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morton, you remember hearing of my beautiful
cousin Edna, and of the sad death of herself and her little
daughter, as we always supposed. This is her daughter,
and I know that when my uncle and aunt meet her,
they will adopt her as their own daughter in her mother&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be impossible to depict the scene that followed,
the surprise and delight of Miss Gladden, or the
deep joy of Morton Rutherford, but by and by, when
they had become more calm, a knock was heard. Houston
opened the door, and Ned Rutherford, looking in,
was entirely unable to comprehend the scene. Houston
held in his hand a small gold locket and a photograph
which he seemed to be comparing with each other. Lyle
looked very pale, but radiantly happy. Morton was
standing near, while Miss Gladden still knelt at her side,
her eyes overflowing with tears of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Ned,&rdquo; said Houston cordially. &ldquo;We want
you here to complete the family group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned looked rather bewildered, as he replied: &ldquo;I just
wanted to inquire for Miss Maverick, to know if she was
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is much better,&rdquo; said Houston with a smile, but
before he could say anything further, Morton turned toward
his brother, saying in gentle, quiet tones, but with
a look in his eye which spoke volumes to Ned&rsquo;s inner
consciousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned, this is Miss Maverick no longer, but Miss Washburn,
the grand-daughter of the Mr. Cameron whom we
expect here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Ned Rutherford! If he had ever laid any claim
to dignity and self-possession, they both deserted him
now. Utterly bereft of speech, he stood for a moment
as if petrified. Then approaching Lyle, he stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss,&ndash;&ndash;Miss Washburn, but that
is always Mort&rsquo;s way, to spring anything on me in such
a fashion as to knock me out completely. I beg your
pardon for appearing so stupid, and I congratulate you
on the good news, and extend you my best wishes, Miss&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, call me Lyle,&rdquo; she interrupted, with a rippling
laugh. &ldquo;I have a right to that name yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said Ned, with the air of a drowning
man clutching at a straw. &ldquo;Thank you; I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s
left for a sort of land mark, you know. I&rsquo;ll call you
&lsquo;Lyle&rsquo; then, &rsquo;till I can get accustomed to the new name,&rdquo;
and he sank in a heap in the nearest chair.</p>
<p>The letter was read, and bitter were the denunciations
against Maverick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel! He ought to be lynched this very
night,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they do those things
out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not late years, Ned,&rdquo; corrected his brother, &ldquo;and even
if they did, that would not be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a question with me,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;situated
just as we are at present, and with Mr. Cameron expected
in a few hours, whether it would be wise to do anything
about this until after his arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;under the circumstances,
you do not want to arouse the antipathy of any of the
miners before Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s coming, and as Maverick
knows nothing of this discovery, he will of course remain
here, and Mr. Cameron can advise in this matter as
he thinks best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the final decision.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
</div>
<p>A few hours later Lyle stood in the gloaming, taking
leave of Jack, in the quaint, cozy room in the cabin, little
dreaming that they stood there together for the last
time.</p>
<p>They had talked long and earnestly of the new life
opening up before her, and her tears flowed fast as she
recalled the happy hours they had spent together, or as
she anticipated the days to come. Her tears were not
the only ones, but the friendly twilight, rapidly deepening,
concealed the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that you have known so much of this
all the time, and did not tell me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was best, my little one, best for each of us. I was
constantly planning how I might bring this about when
the right time came. That time has come, and as my
little girl, whom I have loved as deeply as any one in the
future can ever love her, and whom I have cherished and
helped to the extent of my limited power, goes forth into
this new life, I can and will rejoice in the joy, the love
and the happiness that will be hers. And I know that
amid new scenes, new friends and new loves, she will
never quite forget the old friend and the old love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Jack; I could never forget you, and Everard
and Morton will never forget you. They are coming to
see you to-night. Dear Jack, why could you not give
up this lonely life, and go with us to the east? We
would all love you and make you one of us, and our home
would be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he replied with a slight shudder, &ldquo;you
know not what you ask. I know the love that prompted
it, but never ask it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Lyle, with a sorrowful submission,
&ldquo;but I know what I can do.&rdquo; And she put her arms
about his neck. &ldquo;I will come out to the mountains and
visit you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as he remained silent, she queried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be here, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Jack, where I
could find you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, the agony which his strong, loving heart endured!
How could he tell her that even then he never expected
to look upon her face again! He could not. He only
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, dear, my life is an erratic and wandering
one. No one, not even I, can say where I may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have not lived a wandering life lately; you
have lived here for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the lodestone, the magnet of my heart was
here,&rdquo; he answered half-playfully, half-tenderly. &ldquo;When
that is gone, I shall be likely to fly off in a tangent
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, you must not talk so. I want to see you
in the years to come. I must and I will. I feel it,&rdquo; she
added brightly.</p>
<p>For answer, Jack, for the first time, placed his arms
about her, and for a moment folded her closely to his
breast. Then, bending his head, he kissed her reverently,
first on the forehead, then on the lips, saying, &ldquo;God bless
you always, my dear child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned the kiss, and as he released her, she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, dear Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my dear,&rdquo; he answered, adding under
his breath, &ldquo;and good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had gone, he sat in the gathering darkness
alone, lost in thought. The collie, returning from attending
Lyle on her homeward walk, divined, with keen,
unerring instinct, the sorrow in his master&rsquo;s heart, and
coming close, laid his head upon his knee, in mute sympathy
and affection. His master stroked the noble head,
but his thoughts were far away, and he was only aroused
at length by the sound of voices, as Everard Houston and
Morton Rutherford entered the cabin. The moon had
now risen, and the little room in which he sat was filled
with a soft, silver radiance.</p>
<p>Jack rose to meet his guests, and his quick ear detected
the vibration of a new emotion in Houston&rsquo;s voice, and
as they exchanged greetings, there was something in
the clasp of their hands that night that thrilled the
heart of each one as never before.</p>
<p>At heart, Jack was glad of the presence of Morton
Rutherford. He feared that alone with Houston, after
the events of that day, and in the light of the anticipated
events of the morrow, his own emotions might prove too
strong, weakening the perfect self-control which he felt
he must now exercise. The presence of Rutherford acted
as a tonic, and restored the desired equilibrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston already knows my aversion to a lamp,
and if you do not object, Mr. Rutherford, we will sit for
a while in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Rutherford. &ldquo;I myself dislike
the glare of a bright light for genuine, friendly intercourse.
A soft, subdued light is much more conducive
to mutual confidence and interchange of thought and
feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Houston, after a few moments
of general conversation upon indifferent subjects,
an effort on Jack&rsquo;s part to ward off the inevitable which
he felt was surely coming, &ldquo;You have added very materially
to our happiness to-day, in that you have helped
us to a happy solution of some of the mysteries that have
perplexed us, and in doing this, have brought us all into
much closer relations with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refer, of course, to Lyle,&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;but while
I am very glad to have contributed to your happiness, I
really deserve no credit therefor. I have suspected the
relationship for some time, and was only waiting for
the necessary proofs, which I felt would be found in good
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not the only mystery you have solved for
us, or for me,&rdquo; said Houston. &ldquo;I think we now have a
reason for the interest you have manifested in Lyle, and
the kindness you have shown her; and, speaking for
myself, I believe I have found a clue to the strange bond
of mutual sympathy which has united us almost from
our first meeting, even before we had exchanged one
word; notwithstanding the coldness and reserve of your
manner, I felt that back of it all you were my friend, and
so it has proved. There has sprung up between us an
affection which I believe to be mutual, and of a depth
and power remarkable for such a brief acquaintance.
But to-night there seems, to my mind, to be a reason
for this, which I have been so blind as never to suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may that reason be?&rdquo; inquired Jack,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will understand of course, my dear friend, as I
have often said to you, I have no wish to question you
regarding your life in the past, or to lead you to make
any statements regarding yourself which you would not
make freely and voluntarily; but to me it is evident that,
although we met as strangers, you must sometime have
been at least a trusted friend of the members of my
uncle&rsquo;s family, if not more intimately connected with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause Jack replied, slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are aware, I once knew Lyle&rsquo;s mother, and
her memory is still unspeakably dear to me. I also knew
the other members of Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s family, but that
was all long ago in that past which is gone beyond recall,
and to which any reference only brings the most bitter
pain. When I learned your name and your true business
here, I knew, of course, to what family you belonged,
and I may have felt some degree of interest in
you on that account, but the deep affection between us,
which is, as you say, mutual, is, on my part, wholly for
your own sake, because I knew you worthy of it. Regarding
Lyle, I observed the wonderful resemblance between
her and her mother, and it has been to me a source
both of joy and of pain, especially of late, since it has
grown so marked, and I have sometimes wondered that
you did not observe it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I can see the resemblance so plainly, it
seems strange that I did not think of it before,&rdquo; Houston
replied. &ldquo;She has always reminded me vaguely of
some one, I could not recall whom. I can only account
for it from the fact that I really saw my cousin Edna but
seldom after I went to my uncle&rsquo;s home, as she was married
very soon, and then we saw her only occasionally
until her death, which occurred when I was only about
twelve years of age. Consequently, my recollection of
her was not particularly distinct. I am anticipating the
meeting between her and my uncle and aunt,&ndash;&ndash;they will
recognize her immediately, and I am confident they will
adopt her as their own daughter, in her mother&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack started almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;You do not expect
Mrs. Cameron here with her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not come out with him, but she insisted on
coming as far as Chicago, so that she would be able to
reach us more readily in case of trouble, and I have
thought to-day, since this recent discovery, that if the
case against the company seems likely to take some time,
I might go on to Chicago and bring her out to meet
Lyle, and I would, of course, like her to meet Leslie,
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack remained silent, and withdrew a little farther into
the shadow. It was Morton Rutherford who spoke now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not once tell me, Everard, in the old college
days, that Mr. Cameron had lost a son also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, with a sigh. &ldquo;That was a far
heavier blow for them than the death of their daughter.
He was their joy and pride, their hearts were bound up
in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Jack, in a voice almost cold in its even
calmness. &ldquo;I remember that Miss Cameron,&ndash;&ndash;as I knew
her,&ndash;&ndash;had a brother. Is he also dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are compelled to believe that he must be dead,&rdquo;
Houston answered, after a pause, in a tone of deep sadness.
&ldquo;He left home soon after his sister&rsquo;s death, and we
have never heard from him since, though his parents
searched for him, not in this country alone, but in others
as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon for having alluded to it, Everard,&rdquo;
said Rutherford, &ldquo;you never told me the particulars, and
I did not realize they were so painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies are necessary among us three friends,&rdquo;
Houston replied. &ldquo;Guy&rsquo;s parents and I are the only living
human beings who know, or ever will know, the reason
for his leaving as he did. My uncle spent vast sums
of money and employed detectives all over the world in
his efforts to find him, and to let him know that the old
home was open to him, and would always be just what
it had been in the past. But it was of no avail, we could
not even get any tidings of him, and uncle, long ago,
gave him up for dead, though Aunt Marjorie believes that
he is still living, and that he will yet return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The faith of a good woman is sometimes simply sublime,&rdquo;
replied Rutherford, &ldquo;and a mother&rsquo;s love is something
wonderful. To me it seems the nearest divine of
anything we meet on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no response from the figure sitting motionless
in the shadow. At that moment it required all the
force of his tremendous will power to stem the current
of almost uncontrollable emotion, surging across his soul.</p>
<p>But the moments passed, other topics were introduced
and discussed, and Jack joined in the conversation as
calmly as the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he remarked, as, a little later, he accompanied
his guests to the door, &ldquo;I suppose that before
this time to-morrow, Mr. Cameron will have already arrived
at the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Houston replied, &ldquo;we expect him over on the
evening train, with Van Dorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Houston and Rutherford took leave of Jack, there
was something in his manner, something in the long,
lingering hand-clasp which seemed more like a farewell
than like a simple good-night, at which they silently
wondered.</p>
<p>Could they have looked in upon him an hour later,
they would have understood the cause. Silently he
moved about the room, gathering together the few little
keepsakes among his possessions which he most prized.
These he placed in a small gripsack which he carefully
locked, saying to himself, as he looked around the room
with a sigh, &ldquo;Mike can have the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then going to the window, he stood looking out upon
the calm, moonlit scene, which for many years had been
the only home he had known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my last night here,&rdquo; he soliloquized, &ldquo;my work
here is done. After to-morrow, Everard Houston will
need me no longer, everything in which I can render him
assistance is now done, and his friends will afford him all
needed protection. Lyle has found her own, her future
is provided for. The wrongs which I have witnessed for
years in silence, will be righted without any assistance
of mine. There is nothing more for me to do, and to-morrow
I will start forth on the old, wandering life
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head dropped lower; he was thinking deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said the old home was open, and would always
be what it had been in the past. Home! What would
that not mean now, after all these years! But that was
long ago. I am dead to them now,&ndash;&ndash;dead and forgotten.
They will be happy with their new-found daughter,
and Everard will be to them as a son, their happiness will
be complete, and I will not mar it by any reminders of
the wretched past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced upward at the surrounding peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I go forth again into the mountains,&ndash;&ndash;those
towers of refuge and strength,&ndash;&ndash;and in their soothing
solitudes I shall once more find peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he retired. But to Jack, resting for the last time
in his cabin home, to those then peacefully sleeping in
the little mining camp, or to the others speeding westward
through the night, on the wings of steam, there
came no vision, no thought of what the morrow was, in
reality, to bring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Tuesday morning dawned,&ndash;&ndash;a day never to be forgotten
in the history of the little mining camp, or in the lives
of many outsiders as well.</p>
<p>A strange thrill of subdued excitement ran through
the little group, assembled before breakfast in the porch,
as they realized that the day to which they had looked
forward with varying anticipations had at last arrived;
and there was, unconsciously, a look of watchful expectancy
on every face.</p>
<p>Even Nature herself seemed in sympathy with them.
For a few days the heat had been intense, devouring
with its scorching breath every vestige of verdure on the
mountain sides and foothills, and leaving them dull and
dun. On this particular morning the heat seemed more
terrible than ever, and there was not a breath of air stirring
to cool the oppressive atmosphere. The earth and
sky were suffused with a bright, red light, which gradually
died away into a dim, purplish haze, through which
the sun ascended like a ball of fire; while every blade
and leaf hung motionless, as if awaiting breathlessly the
coming of some great catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This portends a storm,&rdquo; said Houston, as he watched
the strange phenomena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Morton Rutherford, &ldquo;an electric storm,
and, if I am not mistaken, a very severe one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Leslie, in a low tone, to
Lyle, &ldquo;everything is so hushed and still; it seems as if the
elements, like ourselves, were just waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Lyle answered, &ldquo;it seems ominous,&rdquo;
and she shuddered visibly.</p>
<p>There was little breakfast eaten that morning, and the
group of friends adjourned to the porch on the pretext
of watching the weather, thereby attracting the attention
of Haight, who still remained at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the wind now, I wonder,&rdquo; he soliloquized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some kind of excitement here last evening,
and everybody seems on the qui vive this morning.
I guess I&rsquo;d better look into this,&rdquo; and calling Minty to
him, he gave her a quarter, with his most insinuating
smile, saying in low tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find out to-day, if you can, whether there&rsquo;s anything
unusual going on among those folks out there,
and let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pocketed the money with her customary giggle,
as she responded, nodding her head emphatically, &ldquo;You
jest betcher life I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haight then departed for the mills, and Houston soon
after left for the mines, while an hour or two later Morton
Rutherford, taking one of the horses, rode leisurely
in the direction of the Y, where he was to await a telegram
from Van Dorn, immediately upon the arrival of
the Eastern train at Silver City.</p>
<p>In due time the message came, in cipher:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Party arrived all right; over on evening train.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Rutherford replied as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All quiet here. Will wire later if anything occurs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then starting on his return up the canyon, he urged
his horse forward with all possible speed, conscious that
the most critical time was now approaching, and fully
decided regarding his course of action on reaching the
camp.</p>
<p>At the mines, Houston found everything progressing
as usual, the work going forward in the same unending,
monotonous routine.</p>
<p>At the Silver City office of the mining company, however,
the greatest excitement was prevailing. Having
been utterly unable to obtain any clue as to the whereabouts
or the intentions of Mr. Cameron, the mining
company, to guard against being taken wholly by surprise,
had devised a new scheme. Every morning had
found Mr. Wilson seated on the early train which left
Silver City for the East at five A. M., and which was sidetracked
at a small station about ninety miles distant, to
give the right of way to the regular, West-bound Pacific
Express. Here both trains stopped for about fifteen
minutes, affording Mr. Wilson ample opportunity to pass
through the West-bound train, and satisfy himself whether
or not there were any old acquaintances aboard. Failing
to find the party for whom he was seeking, he himself
returned to Silver City on the same train.</p>
<p>On this particular morning, however, upon cautiously
entering one of the sleepers, he had seen, seated in one
section, apparently in close consultation, three gentlemen,
one of whom he immediately recognized as Mr.
Cameron. Opposite and facing him, was an elderly man
whose face Mr. Wilson was unable to see, but the back
of whose head presented a severely judicial appearance,
while at Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s right was seated the English expert
who had come out early in the season with Mr. Winters&rsquo;
party. Evidently, Mr, Cameron was en route for
the mines.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson had hastily retreated, and, stopping at the
little station only just long enough to send a wire to the
company, had returned to the east-bound train, to continue
his journey indefinitely, which had not been a part
of the programme prepared by the officers of the said
company in common with their various other plans. But
Mr. Wilson had suddenly come to the conclusion that
there were other localities better suited to his health just
at that particular time than the great and glorious North
West which had so long been his favorite theme, and
whose praises he had so persistently sung.</p>
<p>It was about ten o&rsquo;clock when Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s telegram,
announcing his discovery, reached the Silver City office,
creating general consternation. After a hurried consultation,
numerous papers and documents were hastily
stored in a private vault belonging to the officers of the
company, a dispatch was sent out over their private wire
to Haight, informing him of the situation and giving certain
instructions; after which Mr. Blaisdell and a confidential
clerk betook themselves to the depot to await the
arrival of the Pacific Express. Concealing themselves
among the crowd, they watched Mr. Cameron and his associates
as they left the train, and having waited till
they were safely ensconced within a carriage, ready to
start for their hotel, Mr. Blaisdell then ordered his clerk
to take another carriage and follow them, remaining at
the hotel long enough to ascertain all he possibly could
concerning their movements, after which he was to report
at the office.</p>
<p>Turning once more toward the crowd, Mr. Blaisdell expected
to meet Mr. Wilson, but to his astonishment and
perplexity, he was nowhere to be seen. From the conductor,
however, who had thought Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s conduct
rather peculiar, he learned the facts in the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said that individual in conclusion, swinging
himself on to the departing train, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the man you&rsquo;re
looking for, he&rsquo;s vamoosed sure, and judging by the way
he got aboard that train, he&rsquo;ll be traveling for some time
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great was the indignation of the remaining officers of
the company on learning of the sudden departure of
their worthy president, and it was not lessened when, upon
investigation at the office, it was discovered that Mr.
Wilson had not only relieved the company of his presence,
but of all the available funds in their private vault
as well, which, at that time, happened to be considerable;
nevertheless, for obvious reasons, it was decided best to
say nothing about it for a few days.</p>
<p>The clerk, on his return from the hotel, stated that none
of Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s party had registered, but had gone immediately
to their rooms, where they had ordered a private
lunch served. He had seen nothing more of them,
but had seen Van Dorn there, however, and upon inquiry
had learned that he had been there since the preceding
day, apparently waiting for some one, evidently this
party, as, immediately upon their arrival, he had sent a
cipher dispatch to some one at the Y; and one of the
party had been heard to inquire quite particularly at what
time the evening train would leave Silver City for Cokeville,
a small station near the Y.</p>
<p>It was evident that Van Dorn was in league with Mr.
Cameron&rsquo;s party, and that they intended going out to the
camp that evening; prompt action was necessary. A
message was sent to Haight, and after his reply, it was
decided that desperate measures were also necessary.</p>
<p>While Morton Rutherford was leisurely riding toward
the Y, Haight, sitting at his desk in his dingy, stifling office,
suddenly heard his name clicked by the little telegraphic
instrument near him. Having given the usual
signal in return, the following message came over the
wire with peremptory haste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Get everything in readiness at once; Cameron coming on
eastern train with mining expert and attorney. Get everything
ready for the final touch and await further instructions
in about two hours.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haight sprang to his feet, and calling one of the men,
ordered, &ldquo;Send Maverick to me as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments the slouching figure of Maverick
stood in the door-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Jim, and shut that door,&rdquo; said Haight, in a
quick, decisive tone that Maverick knew meant business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, in what shape is the powder in those mines?
How long would it take to get everything ready for
action?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maverick&rsquo;s eyes gleamed; here evidently was to be a
piece of work such as he enjoyed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The powder&rsquo;s all there,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;all there, jest in
the right places, an&rsquo; all there is ter do is ter lay the trains
&rsquo;round there an&rsquo; fix a few fuses; &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t take more&rsquo;n
half an hour, or sech a matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you could get it all done at noon, while the
men are away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, now listen; you are to get everything ready
so that it will be nothing but &rsquo;a touch and a go,&rsquo; as soon as
I say the word, understand? Get everything ready this
noon, give the men warning that there&rsquo;s going to be some
blasting, and then, as quick as you&rsquo;ve had your dinner,
you be around here prompt, and stay within sight of this
room till I send you word to quit. You know the rest,
what directions Blaisdell left the last time he was here;
you know what you&rsquo;re to wait for, and if you get a signal
from me, you know what you&rsquo;re to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I do, and I&rsquo;ll do a damned good job, too,&rdquo;
Maverick replied, with a grin; &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the signal,
boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, I want something you&rsquo;ll recognize without
any trouble, and that nobody else would notice, or
think meant anything. Where will you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out there, behind them rocks; I can see your winders
plain from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if I made you any signal there, or put anything
in the window, others would see it as well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, boss,&rdquo; said Maverick, glancing at
the window on the right of Haight&rsquo;s desk, where hung an
old, dilapidated shade, which had been lowered its full
length in an effort to keep out the intolerable heat, &ldquo;you
let that there shade hang jest as it is till you want me, and
when I see that yanked up, I&rsquo;ll know what it means, and
you&rsquo;ll hear from me in jest about ten minits at the latest.
But say, boss, what&rsquo;s all this racket about, anyhow? Some
o&rsquo; them eastern chaps comin&rsquo; out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of your business, Jim,&rdquo; said Haight in a
joking way, &ldquo;you attend to what you&rsquo;ve been told, and
don&rsquo;t meddle with what don&rsquo;t concern you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is old Cameron comin&rsquo; out here?&rdquo; persisted Maverick,
with an expression of fear and hatred combined, visible in
his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cameron!&rdquo; exclaimed Haight, with a slight start, and
wondering at Maverick&rsquo;s appearance, &ldquo;What do you
know about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he owns these &rsquo;ere mines, damn him!&rdquo; answered
Maverick doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you! Well, that&rsquo;s enough, go along, you&rsquo;re not
interested in Cameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I though!&rdquo; said Maverick with a snarl and an
oath, the hatred and wrath increasing in his face; &ldquo;Me&rsquo;n
him has got an old score to settle yet. I only wisht he
was a goin&rsquo; ter be in them mines this afternoon. When&rsquo;s
he comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Haight shortly, &ldquo;probably
before very long though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you git word he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; I wan&rsquo;ter know it,
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; growled Maverick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Haight, beginning to lose his temper,
&ldquo;when you see that curtain raised, you may know he&rsquo;s
coming, and pretty damned quick too; now get out of the
way, and attend to your business. Remember I&rsquo;ve told
you to give the men warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maverick, with a leer, &ldquo;&rsquo;specially the new
superintendent, you&rsquo;d like me ter give &rsquo;im an extra warnin&rsquo;
I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a corresponding leer on Haight&rsquo;s face, as he
replied with a peculiar grimace,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your orders; if you are particularly anxious
to give anybody an extra warning, go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low, cruel laugh, Maverick withdrew, and a few
moments later was shuffling along in the direction of the
mines intent upon the work of destruction assigned to
him, his face distorted with mingled fear and rage, his
usually dull eyes gleaming with the fires of revenge.</p>
<p>Haight hastened to the house to take a hurried dinner,
and having learned from Minty that Morton Rutherford
had gone to the Y, he again charged her to immediately
report to him whatever she might learn, and returned
to the office to await further instructions from the
company.</p>
<p>To Houston, constantly on the alert for danger signals,
Haight&rsquo;s hurried and excited manner was the first indication
of approaching trouble. It was evident that the company
had received some inkling of impending danger, but
of the extent of their information, or the nature of their
communications with Haight, he had no means of ascertaining.
Stating that he wished to see Morton Rutherford
immediately upon his return, and that he would be
at the Yankee Boy, near the entrance to the incline shaft,
he hastened back to the mines at an earlier hour than
usual.</p>
<p>Finding Jack and Mike who had already returned, he
told them of his surmises, and arranged a set of signals,&ndash;&ndash;a
certain number of blows on the rocks above them,&ndash;&ndash;whereby
he would give them warning if he found indications
of immediate danger, upon which they were to make
their escape in an opposite direction, by means of a tunnel,
designated as tunnel No. 3, where he would speedily
join them.</p>
<p>On returning to the shaft, he found the majority of the
men returning to their work as usual, Maverick having
given them no warning, partly through his own cowardice,
and partly through a determination that Houston
should have no hint of what was to follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the long threatened storm was rapidly approaching
with signs of unusual severity. Heavy clouds
had obscured the sun and were, moment by moment,
growing denser and blacker, while the heat was, if possible,
more intense than before. There was that ominous
calm that presages the coming of the tempest, while the
air grew oppressive almost to suffocation. In the distant
canyons, far up among the mountains, could be heard the
muffled roaring of the wind, while the branches began to
sway occasionally under the first hot breath of the approaching
hurricane, which seemed like a blast from a
furnace.</p>
<p>On through the fast-gathering storm rode Morton
Rutherford, urging forward his foam-covered horse, feeling
by a certain, unerring intuition, that that ride through
the winding canyon was a race between life and death.
Having reached the camp, and left his dripping, panting
horse at the stables, he walked rapidly on to the house,
arriving shortly after Houston had left, and just in time
to meet Maverick, hurrying to the house for a bit of food,
his work of preparation having taken longer than he anticipated.</p>
<p>One look at his malignant, demon-like face convinced
Rutherford that he had arrived none too early, and that
his own plans must be put in execution very soon.</p>
<p>Pausing only long enough to exchange a few words
with his brother and the ladies, in reply to their eager
questions, he hurried on to the mines, he and they all
unaware of a figure skulking behind him, in the fast-deepening
gloom, in the direction of the mills. From
an open window, aided by the peculiar condition of the
atmosphere in those altitudes before a storm, which transmits
the slightest sound with wonderful distinctness,
Minty had overheard most of the conversation, and was
hastening to fulfill her contract with Haight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
</div>
<p>Morton Rutherford was not the only one who had observed
the expression on Maverick&rsquo;s face. To Lyle it
seemed she had never seen such venomous malignity as
was in the look which he gave her. Stepping into the
dining room a few moments after Morton had left, she
heard imprecations and curses mingled with her own
name and that of Mr. Cameron, and realized at once that
their secret was known; then, as he hastily left the house,
she heard a few words of bitter hatred which would have
no special meaning to his wife, but which Lyle, knowing
what Houston and his friends had been anticipating for
the last few days, readily understood.</p>
<p>The wind was now raging down the canyon with terrific
force, but Lyle had but one thought, to warn those
whom she loved and save them from danger. Catching
up a light wrap which she threw about her shoulders, she
rushed out of the house, passing Miss Gladden and Ned,
who were in the porch watching the storm, and who tried
to detain her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, what is the matter? Where are you going?&rdquo;
they cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the mines!&rdquo; Lyle answered, raising her voice above
the roar of the storm; &ldquo;They are going to fire the mines,
and they are all there, Morton and Everard and Jack. I
must warn them if I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lyle, come back!&rdquo; shouted Ned, &ldquo;let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head; &ldquo;I must go, I know the mines,&rdquo;
she cried, and turning ran down the road, battling with
the terrific wind, and was out of sight, almost before
they realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Morton Rutherford had found Houston
without difficulty. &ldquo;They are coming, Everard,&rdquo; he
announced, in a low tone, &ldquo;they will be here to-night.
What are the indications here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge from Haight&rsquo;s manner, that word of some
kind has been received from headquarters, but just what
is to be done, or whether there is any immediate danger,
I cannot yet tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going over to Haight&rsquo;s office for a few moments,&rdquo;
said Rutherford, &ldquo;I may catch some message
from the company that will show us the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was intending to suggest,&rdquo; said Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remain here until I come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless I should detect some certain signs of danger;
in that case I shall warn the men, and shall start for
tunnel No. 3, that part of the mine will be safe for a
while, in any event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, you will probably hear from me within
twenty or thirty minutes,&rdquo; and Rutherford started for the
mills.</p>
<p>Haight, on returning to the office from dinner, waited
some little time for the expected dispatch. At last it
came:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cameron just arrived with Englishman, Lindlay, and attorney;
going out to the mines on evening train. Are at
Arlington Hotel, Van Dorn at same hotel and in telegraphic
communication with some one at the Y. There is a conspiracy
somewhere; what do you know? Answer at once; is everything
ready?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was still studying the contents of the telegram,
wondering just what the conspiracy might mean, when
Minty slyly entered, and by means of the information she
had secured, furnished him the needed key to the situation.
In a few moments the following answer was returned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is out; have just discovered Houston is Cameron&rsquo;s
nephew, out here in his interests; Van Dorn et al. working
with him. Cameron coming out to-night for the grand coup.
Everything is ready awaiting your orders.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as the message was sent, Maverick passed on his
way to his post, and seeing him, Haight stepped to the
door and called him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jim, I&rsquo;ve learned the truth at last about that
superintendent of ours, damn him! You seemed so interested
in old Cameron this morning, I thought you&rsquo;d
like to know that it has turned out that this Houston is
his nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houston, old man Cameron&rsquo;s nephew!&rdquo; gasped Maverick,
with a terrible oath, and growing fairly livid,
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d ye get onto that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how, Jim, but it seems he&rsquo;s been out here all
summer getting onto some of our little business ways
and reporting to the old man, and now he&rsquo;s got the old
fellow out here to see the fun. Never mind, Jim, I guess
the fun will be on the other side after all. I&rsquo;ll attend to
my business and you&rsquo;ll attend to yours, but I thought
you&rsquo;d go at it with a better relish after this little piece of
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maverick passed on his way, regardless of the storm,
incapable of coherent speech, muttering oaths and curses
intermingled with the vilest epithets, Haight watching
him with a grim smile for a few moments. Then going
back to his office, he had but just reseated himself at his
desk, when Morton Rutherford entered the outer room.
&ldquo;Damn him! what is he sneaking around here for?&rdquo;
Haight soliloquized, at the same time hastily transferring
a revolver from his desk to his pocket, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spoil that
mug of his if he attempts any funny business here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This movement was seen by Rutherford, who was
watching him closely, but he appeared to take no notice
of it and entered the office as usual, with a civil greeting
to Haight. The latter sprang to his feet, taking his position
close by the shaded window, his right hand grasping
the revolver in his pocket.</p>
<p>Rutherford&rsquo;s lips curled with scorn and contempt as
he looked at Haight; he saw there could be no semblance
of civility between them, it was to be open war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a coward!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are a sneak,&rdquo; Haight hissed in reply, &ldquo;prying
around here when you had better be minding your
own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you that I am attending to my own business,
and you will find before you are much older, that I
have more right here than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Haight hesitated, astonished by Rutherford&rsquo;s
words and manner, then was about to make some
reply, when the click of the instrument attracted his attention.
Keeping his eye on Rutherford, he gave the
answering signal with his left hand, then listened intently
for the message. It came, containing the final orders and
the farewell words of the Silver City office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Send the mines to hell, and Houston and his crowd with
them. Look out for yourself. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his interest in the message, Haight seemed, for an
instant, to have partially forgotten Rutherford&rsquo;s presence,
his eyes dropped toward the instrument, and in that
instant, Rutherford cleared the space between them at a
bound, gripping Haight firmly with one hand, while with
the other he knocked the revolver which Haight had
hastily drawn, half way across the room. With a single
blow he knocked Haight to the floor, partially stunning
him, but as he regained his senses, he rolled over towards
the window, and with a strength born of desperation,
struggled to his knees, and before Rutherford
realized what he was trying to do, the shade flew upward
to the top of the window. Even then, Rutherford would
have thought little of it, had not Haight betrayed himself
by a leer of fiendish triumph. In an instant Rutherford
understood that it had been some pre-arranged signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cowardly villain!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and pausing
only long enough to give him a blow which left him unconscious
on the floor, he rushed forth into the darkness
and fury of the storm, in the direction of the mines.</p>
<p>As he did so, he stumbled against a small boy, running
even more swiftly in the same direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister, Mister Houston! is that you?&rdquo; rang out Bull-dog&rsquo;s
voice, above the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my boy, I am going to find Mr. Houston, to save
him if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, let me go! I know about it, they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
fire the mines, I heerd Jake say so, and I was a goin&rsquo; to
find Mister Houston myself; I&rsquo;ll get there quicker, &rsquo;n I
know the mine better &rsquo;n you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my boy, you risk your own life,&rdquo; said Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, sir; Mister Houston, he&rsquo;s been my
friend, &rsquo;n his life&rsquo;s worth more&rsquo;n mine anyhow; I&rsquo;ll risk
it,&rdquo; and he was already rushing on ahead, shouting back
to Rutherford, &ldquo;You go to the tunnels, sir, you can help
him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him the signal has been given!&rdquo; called Rutherford,
and Bull-dog, swinging his ragged hat in reply,
sped swiftly on through the raging wind.</p>
<p>Rutherford paused for a moment, then started in the
direction of the tunnels. At that instant, Lyle, still struggling
against the fury of the wind, had just reached the
ground surrounding the mines; in a few seconds more
she would have been within the fatal boundary line, but
Bull-dog&rsquo;s voice, as he rushed past, warned her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back, go back, Miss Lyle! they&rsquo;ve given the signal
to fire the mines, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to warn &rsquo;em; don&rsquo;t be afraid,
I&rsquo;ll save &rsquo;em, Mister Houston and Jack,&rdquo; and with these
words, he rushed on, disappearing through the incline
shaft.</p>
<p>Lyle retreated a few steps, and then paused, looking
wildly about her, dreading, expecting, she scarcely knew
what.</p>
<p>Suddenly the darkness seemed divided by a blinding
flash, which spread into a sheet of flame, enveloping her
within its lurid folds, while peal after peal of deafening
thunder crashed and roared about her, and the lightning
flashed and gleamed till it seemed as if earth and sky were
commingled in one mass of flaming combat.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the blinding flashes died in darkness, and
the reverberations of the thunder still echoed and re-echoed
among the surrounding mountains, when the
earth began to rock and vibrate beneath her feet; there
was the sound of a terrific explosion, she felt for an instant
a strange sensation as if floating through the air,&ndash;&ndash;then
she knew nothing more; she had been thrown to
the ground, unconscious, by the shock.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down the rough, narrow road, leading to
the mines, Leslie Gladden and Ned Rutherford were
making their way, having started immediately after Lyle,
but unaccustomed to the furious mountain storms and
unfamiliar with the road, they made slow progress in the
darkness and tempest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gladden, this is too hard for you,&rdquo; said Ned, as
they paused once, gasping for breath, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it
is safe either, you ought never to have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care for difficulty or danger?&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;Think of Lyle going through this storm alone; I only
pray she may not have been too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had she finished speaking, when, without an
instant&rsquo;s warning, the timber through which they were
passing suddenly seemed one mass of blinding flame,
while almost simultaneously came the deafening crash of
the thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens! that must have struck awfully near
us!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, but no cry escaped from Leslie&rsquo;s lips,
as, shuddering, she clasped his arm more closely and
struggled bravely on.</p>
<p>It was not until a few seconds later, when there came
the sound of the terrible explosion, followed by the
bursting and crashing of the rocks, while the ground
quivered and trembled as though shaken by an earthquake,
that, for an instant, her courage failed, and with a
low cry, she sank to the ground, shivering with horror.
But only for an instant, and then she rose to her feet,
dizzy and trembling from the shock, but brave and determined
as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said hoarsely, &ldquo;we must hasten; perhaps
we can help them in some way, even if we are too late to
save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speechless from a horrible, sickening realization of all
which that terrible shock might mean to those whom
they were striving to save, Ned silently helped her forward.
They had gone but a few steps, when there suddenly
burst upon the dark and stormy heavens a dull, red
glare, which grew brighter moment by moment, and on
emerging from the timber into the open ground, a frightful
scene met their gaze.</p>
<p>Dense clouds of smoke were pouring from the shafts
of the nearest mine, while, at a little distance, could be
seen the mills, their whole interior already ablaze with
light. In that end of the buildings containing the sorting
rooms and Haight&rsquo;s office, the fire was raging, having
come in contact with quantities of chemicals which had
increased its fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; ejaculated Ned, &ldquo;the mills were struck,
and are on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Leslie uttered a sharp cry, and ran swiftly down the
path to where Lyle lay unconscious, followed quickly by
Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child, poor child!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;oh, merciful
heaven, she came too late, and they are all lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she knelt beside the unconscious form, there
came another terrific explosion, which seemed to jar even
the rocks about them to their very foundations, while
from the already smoking shafts, the flames now issued,
towering higher and higher, and adding new terror to the
scene.</p>
<p>Men were seen running from all directions, from the
distant groups of mines, rushing to the burning mills,
where the little fire corps belonging to the camp, were
already engaged in a futile battle with the flames; but
around the Yankee Boy mine there was no sign of life.</p>
<p>The rain now began to descend in torrents, and the
first dash of the storm seemed to revive Lyle, whom Leslie
and Ned had raised to a sitting posture in their efforts
to restore her to consciousness. Slowly she opened her
eyes with a bewildered look, then springing to her feet,
still weak and trembling, but resolute and determined,
she gazed about her at the flaming shafts and burning
mills, and suddenly cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can remember now! I remember it all, it has
come back to me,&ndash;&ndash;the terrible wreck, the burning cars
all around us, and my mother crushed in the wreck; then
the people carried us out and they put me down beside
her, lying so white and still, and then,&ndash;&ndash;then that villain
came and took me away,&ndash;&ndash;I can see it all,&rdquo; and she shuddered.</p>
<p>Then looking at Leslie and Ned, who were watching
her with startled faces, she seemed trying to recall the
present situation. Before either of them could speak,
however, there came the report of another explosion,
more distant and deeper underground than any that had
yet occurred, and the sound seemed to bring back to Lyle
the memory of her last moments of consciousness before
the first terrible shock, while the faces of her companions
were blanched with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now,&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly, &ldquo;I was too late,
but Bull-dog warned them, and they are probably safe;
we must go to the tunnels, they will make their escape
there, and we may help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran swiftly down the path leading the way, while
they followed only too gladly, their hearts filled with new
hope.</p>
<p>The men, finding it impossible to check the flames at
the mills, were flocking in the direction of the Yankee
group of mines. Fearing, however, to approach very
near the scene of danger, they gathered in groups here
and there, while a company of wretched women, the
wives and daughters of the few married men who worked
in the fated mines, ran hither and thither, sobbing and
wringing their hands in their agony of fear and suspense
for their own loved ones. Seeing Lyle leading the way
to the tunnels, they all, men and women, followed in the
same direction.</p>
<p>The fury of the storm had passed; a heavy rain was still
falling, but the wind had subsided, and the clouds had
lifted and were already breaking away.</p>
<p>Arriving at the tunnels, they found a crowd of men,
among them a number who had made their escape from
the mines. The hearts of Ned Rutherford and Lyle
throbbed with joy as they descried Morton standing
among the crowd, but Lyle&rsquo;s heart sank again with sickening
dread as she saw no signs of Everard Houston or
of Jack, while Leslie Gladden moaned in despair. Morton
Rutherford was unhurt, except for a few bruises from
flying rocks, and he was pleading with some of the men,
and offering large sums of money to any one or two who
would go with him into the tunnel in search of Houston
and some of the missing men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Houston told me that this part of the mine would
be safe for some time,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and I will pay a
thousand dollars to any one who will go with me as
guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment no one responded, then one of the men
who had escaped, spoke,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t go back in that there mine for five
thousand dollars, I&rsquo;m out, an&rsquo; I stays out,&rdquo; while another
added, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be of no use, sir; mos&rsquo; likely he was
catched in some o&rsquo; them cave-ins; he stopped to give us
all warnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; he was about the last one to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; exclaimed Lyle, stepping forth among
them with blazing eyes, &ldquo;he risked his life to save yours,
and you will not even try to save him. Morton,&rdquo; she
added, turning toward her lover, &ldquo;I know every step of
the tunnels, and I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men slunk back like whipped curs, but made no
response. The miners employed by the company throughout
this group of mines were of the lowest class, and they
were none too friendly to Houston, while the better
class of men employed in the other mines were not familiar
with these workings.</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford advanced to meet Lyle; &ldquo;My
darling,&rdquo; he said, in low tones, &ldquo;I cannot allow you to
subject yourself to danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather share the danger with you,&rdquo; she replied
proudly, &ldquo;besides we must save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go, too,&rdquo; said Ned eagerly, &ldquo;I surely can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lyle was about to suggest that he remain with Miss
Gladden, but Leslie herself interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I do not need him,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;I
would suffer no more waiting alone, and he may do much
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, two young men from another group of
mines stepped forward; &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said one of
them, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want no money, and we can&rsquo;t act as
guides, not being acquainted with the lay of things
around here, but we&rsquo;d like to help you, for we like Mr.
Houston, and we&rsquo;re his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their offer was gladly accepted, and preparations were
hastily and silently made by the little party. Wet cloths
and sponges were fastened across the lower portion of
their faces, to prevent their inhaling the smoke and gases,
while ropes were securely tied about their waists, the ends
of which were to be held by persons on the outside. A
frequent jerking of the rope would assure those outside
that all was right in the tunnel, but a suspension of the
jerking would indicate that that person had been overcome
by the gases, and he would be immediately drawn
out to the fresh air, by those at the outer end of the line.</p>
<p>Pausing only for a bright smile of encouragement to
Leslie, Lyle led the way into the tunnel, followed by Morton
and Ned, the two miners bringing up the rear, and
all disappeared in the subterranean darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
</div>
<p>When Bull-dog&rsquo;s voice rang out above the storm, with
its warning to Lyle, Houston, standing near the entrance
of the shaft, alert, watchful for the first indication of danger,
heard the words distinctly and acted instantly.</p>
<p>Having given the usual danger signal, he shouted, &ldquo;To
the tunnels, boys, for your lives! The mine has been
fired, go to the tunnels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On returning from giving the agreed signal to Jack and
Mike, he heard Bull-dog&rsquo;s voice above him in the shaft,
calling his name and shouting the warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my boy,&rdquo; shouted Houston in return, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
start for the tunnels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, I&rsquo;m a comin&rsquo;, I know the way, but don&rsquo;t you
wait fer me &rsquo;cause you may git catched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not leave you, Bull-dog, we&rsquo;ll go together,&rdquo;
Houston answered, waiting for the little figure gliding
swiftly toward him in the darkness.</p>
<p>Suddenly the rocks by which they were surrounded began
to quiver and vibrate; there was a deafening roar followed
by a terrific crash, and an instant later, a mass of
loosened rock was tearing its way through the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cling to the wall, Bull-dog,&rdquo; shouted Houston, at the
same time seizing a projecting ledge with a vise-like grip,
and swinging himself upward, where he hung by his
hands and wrists. It was a horrible position, but his
powerful, athletic muscles bore the strain until the grinding,
tearing mass had passed, and he dropped, scratched
and bruised, but otherwise unhurt, to the ground.</p>
<p>As he did so, he heard a faint moan, and hastening in
the direction from whence it came, found Bull-dog, who,
unable to spring high enough to escape the passing rocks,
had been swept along and partially buried under the
debris that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, are you hurt?&rdquo; asked Houston, bending over
him in the darkness, and removing as fast as possible the
mass of crushed and broken rock under which he lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I guess,&rdquo; replied the little, familiar voice,
in tones that tried to be brave and cheery, but which
quivered with pain, &ldquo;I tried to hold on, Mister Houston,
but that big rock was a little too much fer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Houston at last freed him, the little fellow tried to
rise, but sank quickly back, with an involuntary cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m done fer&ndash;&ndash;Mister Houston,&rdquo; he gasped
faintly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care&ndash;&ndash;if you only&ndash;&ndash;get out safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smoke and gases were now pouring down the
shaft, and Houston realized that there was no time to be
lost. Very tenderly he lifted the little form in his arms,
and began, as rapidly as possible, the descent of the shaft,
groping his way amid the rocks, toward the cut leading to
the tunnels, through which he hoped to escape.</p>
<p>The motion roused Bull-dog who had fainted. &ldquo;Mister
Houston,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mind me&ndash;&ndash;I wanted to save
you, and I guess you can make it yet, if you hurry and
don&rsquo;t bother with me; I won&rsquo;t mind bein&rsquo; left here, &rsquo;cause
I&rsquo;ll know then that you&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, my boy,&rdquo; replied Houston, and his
own voice trembled, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll reach daylight all right, but
we&rsquo;ll reach it together; I&rsquo;ll never leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply except a contented, confiding nestling
of the little head against Houston&rsquo;s shoulder; then,
as a second explosion thundered above them, jarring the
foundations of the rocks once more, he murmured drowsily,
&ldquo;There she goes again,&rdquo; and sank into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>The smoke was now so stifling that Houston was
obliged to go upon his hands and knees, carrying Bull-dog
in one arm; his progress was necessarily slow, but to
his great joy he succeeded in finding the cut leading to
tunnel No. 3; then, to his horror, he discovered that the
entrance was blocked by a mass of earth and loose rock
which had caved in.</p>
<p>Laying Bull-dog carefully down, he examined the obstruction,
and found there was a small opening at the top,
and that the mass was of such a character that it could
easily be removed with pick and shovel, but he had nothing.
With desperate energy, he began tearing away the
earth and rocks with his hands, then to his intense relief,
after a few moments&rsquo; work, he heard voices on the other
side. Houston listened; it was Jack and Mike, who, having
waited for him in the tunnel, expecting him to join
them immediately, had become alarmed at his non-appearance,
and were returning with their picks and shovels,
which they had taken out with them, calling him and
searching for him.</p>
<p>Houston shouted, and they hastened to the rescue,
and the entrance was very quickly cleared sufficiently for
Houston to crawl through. Before passing through,
himself, however, he lifted Bull-dog, and carefully handed
the unconscious form to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; the latter asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bull-dog, the little hero who has saved our lives by
sacrificing his own,&rdquo; Houston replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently and tenderly Jack handed the little fellow to
the tender-hearted Mike, who at once started toward the
tunnel with his burden, while Jack turned to assist Houston.</p>
<p>At that instant, there came the third explosion, which
was farther underground than either of those preceding.
It was but a short distance from them, and an immense
scale of overhanging rock quivered for an instant, then
fell, throwing its fragments in every direction. Mike, at
the distance which he had already gained, escaped unhurt.
Jack and Houston sprang in opposite directions, but the
pieces of flying rock overtook them, though they escaped
being buried beneath the mass as it fell. They were both
thrown to the ground; Houston staggered to his feet,
badly bruised and cut and his left arm broken, but Jack
remained motionless.</p>
<p>Hearing Houston&rsquo;s call, Mike quickly returned, and he
and Houston found that Jack was still alive, though badly
injured about the head. The full extent of his injuries
they realized they would be unable to ascertain until they
could reach the surface. Together they consulted as to
the best course to pursue. Mike wished to go back and
get help immediately, but Houston insisted that they must
first remove Jack and little Bull-dog as speedily as possible,
as there was danger of other explosions following
now in rapid succession, and also danger from the smoke
and gases of the gradually approaching flames, which
were consuming the timbering of the various shafts, and
would at length communicate with the tunnels also.</p>
<p>Instructing Mike to lay Jack&rsquo;s head across his shoulder,
Houston then clasped his right arm closely about
Jack&rsquo;s neck and shoulders. Mike, carrying Bull-dog on
one arm, with the other was to lift Jack underneath the
knees; and in this way they started for the tunnel.</p>
<p>Houston suffered excruciating pain from the arm
hanging helpless at his side, but he traveled forward
without a murmur, scarcely conscious of his own suffering
in his anxiety for Jack. The cut was comparatively
short, but their progress was slow.</p>
<p>Nearly overcome by the suffocating gases and the
smoke, and faint from pain and loss of blood, Houston
had just staggered into the tunnel, when he heard the
welcome sound of the voices of Lyle and of Morton
Rutherford, and knew that they were saved.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_XLVI' id='CHAPTER_XLVI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, the work of destruction went swiftly forward,
explosions following in quick succession and with
terrific force, throughout the Yankee group of mines,
and the adjoining claims; while the flames from the burning
shafts were rivaled by those which spread from the
mills to the shops, storehouses and stables, and finally, to
the miners&rsquo; quarters, till all were speedily reduced to
ashes.</p>
<p>Around the entrance to tunnel No. 3, a large crowd had
gathered, not only from the various mines, but also from
neighboring mining camps, all anxiously awaiting the
return of the rescue party.</p>
<p>At last they appeared. The first to emerge into daylight,
was Ned Rutherford, bearing in his arms the
crushed and mutilated form of little Bull-dog. Behind
him came Houston, partially supported by one of the
young miners and by Lyle, his left arm hanging at his
side, his face deathly white beneath the blood and grime,
but firm and dauntless as ever. As he stepped forth into
the light, a wild cheer rose on the air, but Houston, raising
his right hand with a deprecatory motion, silently
pointed backward toward the tunnel, where, slowly
emerging into view of the crowd, were Morton Rutherford
and Mike, carrying, with the assistance of the other
miner, the bleeding and unconscious form of Jack.</p>
<p>The cheers were hushed, and the crowd silently surged
about Houston and the two motionless, unconscious
forms laid side by side upon the ground, their heads pillowed
upon the rough jackets of the men, folded and tenderly
placed beneath them by the hands of Lyle and Leslie,
the latter half fainting with excitement.</p>
<p>The men crowding about Houston congratulated him
with a hearty hand-clasp, unaccompanied by words, except
for an occasional inquiry as to his own condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all right,&rdquo; he said in reply to the latter, &ldquo;my arm
is nothing, the merest trifle; my only thought is for the
two lives which I fear have been sacrificed for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously he bent above the prostrate forms. Jack&rsquo;s
head was frightfully gashed, and his heavy, labored
breathing indicated that his brain was already affected.
Houston spoke a word to Morton Rutherford, who
quickly withdrew, and taking the swiftest horse in camp,
was soon speeding down the road to the Y, in a second
race against death.</p>
<p>Houston next knelt beside Bull-dog; a faint fluttering
about the heart was the only sign of life. The little waif
was well known among the mining camps of that vicinity,
and there were few dry eyes in the crowd as Houston told
the story of his heroism.</p>
<p>Houston saw the end was very near, and gently
slipped his right arm under Bull-dog&rsquo;s head. Slowly the
little fellow opened his eyes, looking, with a happy smile,
into the face bending so tenderly over him. At that instant,
the sun, bursting through the clouds, threw a ray
of golden light in shining benediction across the little
white face. His eyes brightened still more; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;
he whispered joyously. There was a slight quiver, and
the little form was still.</p>
<p>The sun, shining as brightly and serenely as though
storms were unknown, looked down into that beautiful
canyon upon a strange scene of ruin, desolation and
death. Amid the wreck and debris of the explosions, lay
the little hero who had saved so many lives that day, upon
his face a child-like smile which it had never worn in life;
while farther on down the canyon, beside the smoking
embers of the milling plant, lay the one whose signal had
wrought all this destruction. The men, rushing into the
burning mills, had found the electrical apparatus in ruins,
as though torn to pieces by giant hands, and beside it upon
the floor lay Haight, a ghastly sight, his face blackened
and distorted, his right arm and side seared and shriveled,
by the mighty servant who had suddenly burst its fetters.</p>
<p>Slowly and tenderly Jack was borne to the house, and
laid in the room which had been Houston&rsquo;s, which Lyle
had made ready for him with loving care, her tears falling
fast as she recalled his farewell of the preceding night.
To the house came also his two faithful friends, Mike and
Rex, for the little cabin was no more, Jack had indeed
spent his last night beneath its roof, though the succeeding
night, to which he had looked forward, was far different
from his anticipations.</p>
<p>Days afterward, his gripsack, packed with such care on
that last night in the cabin, was found by Houston concealed
among the rocks, where Jack had hidden it on the
morning of that eventful day, intending, when his work
was done, to set forth upon his wandering life once more.</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford, on arriving at the Y, had sent the
following cipher dispatch to Van Dorn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Come out on special at once. The mines have been fired
by telegraphic orders from Silver City office. Everard badly
cut and arm broken, but not seriously injured. Jack but just
alive. Bring surgeons and nurse as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having sent this message, and finding there was a very
good physician at the Y, he sent him at once to the camp,
to remain there until the surgeons should arrive, doing
meantime all in his power to relieve the sufferers. Then
giving orders for one of the company&rsquo;s men to take his
horse, and replace it with a fresh one, Morton returned to
the station to await Van Dorn&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>At the house, Jack was being cared for by Mike and
one of the older miners, who had had considerable experience
in nursing, Houston doing everything which his
crippled condition and the intense pain he was suffering,
would permit.</p>
<p>On the arrival of the physician from the Y, he first
visited Jack, and leaving directions to be carried out for
his temporary relief, next attended to the setting of Houston&rsquo;s
arm and the dressing of his wounds. The operation
required some time, but at last it was completed, and
Houston returned to Jack&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>The room had been darkened, and in accordance with
the physician&rsquo;s directions, Jack&rsquo;s beard had been shaven
and his hair closely cut, to relieve his head as much as
possible. His breathing was more natural, but he lay
quiet and motionless as before.</p>
<p>As Houston approached the bed in the dim light, he
scarcely recognized his friend, so great was the change in
his appearance, but as he drew nearer, he started visibly.
Something in the smooth face and closely clipped head
seemed wonderfully familiar, and carried him back to the
days when he had first entered his uncle&rsquo;s home. Bending
over him for an instant, he scanned the features more
closely. It was enough! The face with its patrician features
carved in such perfect beauty, though lined by sorrow,
was the face of his cousin,&ndash;&ndash;his boyish hero and
ideal.</p>
<p>With a quick, dry sob, Houston turned from the bedside,
more deeply moved than any of his associates had
ever seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in low tones, &ldquo;it is Guy
Cameron! my cousin Guy!&rdquo; and bending over the unconscious
form once more, while the great tears coursed
slowly down his face, he murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy, dear old fellow, and you have known me all this
time! God grant this has not come too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low cry, Lyle had sprung to Houston&rsquo;s side,
while Leslie and Ned Rutherford followed, and the others
looked on in mute wonder and astonishment. Her quick
ear had caught the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo; she cried eagerly, &ldquo;Did you
say Guy Cameron? Is Jack&ndash;&ndash;my Jack&ndash;&ndash;is he my mother&rsquo;s
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston bowed in assent, he could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; moaned Lyle, &ldquo;no wonder that he loved us so!
and we have not loved him half enough!&rdquo; and dropping
on her knees beside the bed, sobbing bitterly, she seized
the hand, nearly as white as the sheet upon which it lay,
and covered it with passionate kisses.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Morton Rutherford entered the
room; Lyle was still kneeling by the bedside; beside her
was Leslie, quietly weeping. Ned&rsquo;s eyes were suspiciously
red, while in one corner, honest-hearted Mike was
vainly trying to check his fast-flowing tears upon the
sleeves of his blouse. Morton looked quickly toward the
strangely altered face upon the pillows, and was struck by
its wondrous beauty.</p>
<p>Glancing inquiringly at Houston, as he advanced to
meet him, he asked anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no change yet, one way or another,&rdquo;
Houston replied in low tones, and continued, &ldquo;Morton,
we were speaking last night, at the cabin, of my uncle&rsquo;s
son,&ndash;&ndash;my cousin, Guy Cameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is found,&rdquo; Houston&rsquo;s voice trembled, and he could
say no more, but Morton understood. He gazed with
new and tearful interest upon the beautiful face in its
death-like calm; then beckoning to Houston, he said, as
they passed from the room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you have at last found the key to the wondrous
bond between you, and to his self-sacrificing love toward
you and yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments they recalled certain incidents in
their acquaintance with the silent, yet gentle and courteous
occupant of the little cabin, and much that had
seemed mysterious was now clear and plain in the light
of this recent revelation.</p>
<p>At last Morton said; &ldquo;I must hasten back to the Y,&rdquo;
at the same time handing his friend the telegram received
from Van Dorn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Leave in half an hour on special, with surgeons and nurse.
Whitney and Lindlay remain here to attend to business. Warrants
for arrests have been issued.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said Houston, with a sigh of relief,
&ldquo;They are already on their way. And now, my dear Morton,
I have one other commission for you, if you are willing
to perform it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I am at your service,&rdquo; Morton replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt, whose faith and love have watched and
waited for her son&rsquo;s return during all these years, must
be brought here as quickly as possible. I am not in very
good condition for travel, and do not feel that I can leave
Guy. I know I can trust her in your care, you will be to
her as a son, and such she will regard you when she knows
all, and I commission you in my name to meet her and
bring her out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will very gladly do, my dear Everard, and at
once; there must be no delay. By going out this evening,
I will be able to take the early train east from Silver City:
the special arrives at 6:10, the six o&rsquo;clock train being
held at the Y, until after its arrival. I will return to the
Y, meet Mr. Cameron and have a word with him, and go
directly on to Silver City on the regular train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, having hastily packed a small
grip, and taken a tender farewell of Lyle, who knew his
errand, and with tearful eyes bade him &ldquo;God-speed,&rdquo; Morton
Rutherford left the house, accompanied by Ned, who
was to return with Mr. Cameron and Van Dorn.</p>
<p>The sun was slowly sinking behind the crests of the
mountains, flooding the surrounding peaks with glory,
when a wagon drawn by four panting, foaming horses,
drew up before the house.</p>
<p>From the front seat beside the driver, Ned Rutherford
and Van Dorn sprang hastily to the ground, turning
quickly to assist a fine-looking, elderly gentleman, with
iron-gray hair and beard, whose dark, piercing eyes bore
a strong resemblance to those of both Houston and Jack.
He needed little assistance, however, and having alighted,
turned with firm step and erect bearing, but with an expression
of deep anxiety, toward the house, followed by
the two young men, and by three strangers.</p>
<p>At that instant Houston appeared within the little
porch, his left arm in a sling, his face pale and haggard,
though with a grave smile of affectionate welcome.</p>
<p>Even in that brief instant, Mr. Cameron could not but
observe the change which those few short months had
wrought in the face of Everard Houston, the high-born
son of wealth and culture, the pet of society; it had matured
wonderfully; alert and keen, yet grave and thoughtful,
he looked as though he had found a deeper and
broader meaning to life than he had ever dreamed of in
his luxurious eastern home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cameron, hastening toward
him, &ldquo;are you sure you have escaped without serious injury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; Houston replied, limping slightly, as he
advanced to meet his uncle, &ldquo;my arm was hurt, and I am
somewhat scratched and bruised and a little weak, but
otherwise, sound as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God for that! I don&rsquo;t mind the loss of the
property if you are safe; all the way out here, my boy, I
have been reproaching myself for ever allowing you to
come out to this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear uncle,&rdquo; Houston replied, with peculiar emphasis,
&ldquo;I think you will soon find you have reason to be
very glad and grateful that I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron introduced the two surgeons and the
nurse; &ldquo;I feared,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from your sending for these
gentlemen that you might be hurt far more seriously than
I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;but the one who has nearly sacrificed
his own life in helping to save mine, needs their
best skill, and I sent for them on his account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was right,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cameron, &ldquo;all that
money can do shall be done for him,&rdquo; while one of the
surgeons said, &ldquo;We will see our patient at once, Mr.
Houston, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see him very soon,&rdquo; Houston replied with
grave courtesy, &ldquo;but there are reasons why my uncle must
first see him, and alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron looked surprised, but silently followed
Houston into the room which had been occupied by the
two brothers, but which was now prepared for him. Then
observing something peculiar in Houston&rsquo;s manner as
he closed the door, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, if I seem abrupt, uncle,&rdquo; Houston answered,
&ldquo;but every moment is precious in saving a life unspeakably
dear to each of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron looked startled; Houston continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been like a father to me all these years, and
I have felt toward you as a son, but to-day I have the joy
of bringing you to the one, who holds in your heart, and
always will hold, precedence even over myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard, my boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cameron, in tones
vibrating with suppressed emotion, &ldquo;what is it? Speak
quickly, do not keep me in suspense,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear uncle,&rdquo; said Houston very tenderly, &ldquo;the lost
is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron sank, nearly overcome, into the nearest
chair, while his face grew deathly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy?&rdquo; he gasped, looking upward at Houston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the latter brokenly.</p>
<p>The strong man covered his face with his hands, while
his powerful frame shook with emotion.</p>
<p>Houston, when he was able to speak, told him, very
briefly, of his meeting with Jack, of their association, and
the strange bond of sympathy and affection between
them, of Jack&rsquo;s devotion, and how at last, he had been
enabled to recognize him.</p>
<p>Controlling himself with a mighty effort, Mr. Cameron
rose, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening the door connecting the two rooms, Houston
signaled to those within to leave the room, then led the
father into the presence of the son whom he had so long
mourned as dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron walked to the bedside, and looked long
and earnestly upon the white face, drawn with pain, but
still beautiful, and bearing to a great extent, the imprint
of his own features; then as he tenderly clasped the hand
lying upon the sheet, he murmured brokenly, between
great, tearless sobs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he, my boy, my son! Thank God, it is not too
late!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
</div>
<p>There was a long consultation between the physicians
and surgeons following a careful and thorough examination
of their patient, before the rendering of their decision.</p>
<p>He had received various injuries of a serious character,
but the injury to the head was far the most dangerous of
all. There was a possibility that with the most careful
nursing and the most skillful medical aid, he might live,
but his recovery was exceedingly doubtful,&ndash;&ndash;one chance
out of a hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your best,&rdquo; was Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s reply to this decision,
&ldquo;do your best, regardless of cost; if you wish counsel,
have it; send out another nurse, the best you can secure,
to relieve this one, and I wish one or the other of
you gentlemen to remain here constantly, we must not
be left without a physician. I may as well inform you
now,&rdquo; Mr. Cameron added, with great dignity, in conclusion,
&ldquo;that your patient is my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astonishment was depicted upon the faces of the physicians,
but Mr. Cameron continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some months my nephew has been out here incognito,
engaged in unearthing the dishonest schemes
and plots of the mining company who constituted our
western agents, and I have just discovered that he was
aided in this work by my son, who, unknown to me, was
out here in disguise, working with the same end in view.
You will, of course, understand, gentlemen, that money
is no object; do everything within your power, and you
shall be abundantly compensated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was arranged that one or two physicians were
constantly at the house, and when these returned to Silver
City for a few hours, others took their places.</p>
<p>A competent cook and housekeeper were also sent out
from Silver City, as the excitement resulting from the
terrible events of that day, together with her husband&rsquo;s
connection therewith, which had in some way become
generally known, proved too much for the feeble strength
of Mrs. Maverick, and she was prostrated by the shock.</p>
<p>Minty, terror-stricken by the results which she believed
had followed her report to Haight, and by his fearful fate,
in a fit of hysteria, confessed the share she had taken in
the plot, and was summarily dismissed.</p>
<p>After the coming of Mr. Cameron with the surgeons
and nurse, Lyle and Leslie had withdrawn from the sick-room,
and busied themselves in caring for Mrs. Maverick,
and in superintendence of the necessary work; Van Dorn,
whose astonishment at the revelations of the last two days
was beyond expression, keeping them informed of the
condition of the sufferer. Lyle was pale with excitement,
but calmly and bravely took her place as head of the
strangely assorted household, her heart throbbing wildly
as she anticipated the meeting with Mr. Cameron.</p>
<p>Within the sick-room the soft, gray twilight had deepened
into darkness. At one side of the bed sat the nurse,
his fingers upon the pulse of the patient, while he listened
attentively to his breathing, now becoming irregular, and
broken by low moans and occasional mutterings. On the
other side sat Mr. Cameron, his head bowed upon his
hands, his mind going back to the years of Guy&rsquo;s childhood
and youth. How vividly he recalled many little incidents,
seemingly trivial when they occurred, but carefully
treasured among the most precious memories in the
long, sad years that followed! With the memory of his
son, his heart&rsquo;s pride and joy, came also that of the
beautiful daughter, with her golden hair and starry eyes,
the light of their home in those happy days.</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron seemed lost in thought, but in reality,
while thus reviewing the past, his mind was keenly conscious
of the present. In one corner sat the faithful Mike,
while at his feet lay the equally faithful Rex, who could be
neither coaxed nor driven from the room, but remained
quietly watching his master&rsquo;s face, an almost human love
and sorrow looking out of his eyes, as he answered the
occasional moans with a low, piteous whine.</p>
<p>In another corner Everard talked in low tones with
the two physicians who were to remain that night, Mr.
Cameron taking cognizance, in the midst of his own sorrowful
thoughts, of every word.</p>
<p>At length some one called for a light, and a moment
later, Mr. Cameron was conscious of a light step crossing
the room, and of a lamp being placed on the table
near the physicians, though none of its rays fell in the
direction of the sufferer. Lifting his head, he saw the
lamp with a screen so attached as to throw a shade over
almost the entire room, leaving only a small portion
lighted; but within that brightly illumined portion he had
a glimpse, for an instant, of a face, which with its radiant
eyes and its shining aureole of golden hair, was so
nearly a counterpart of the one but just recalled so
vividly to his mind, that it seemed a living reproduction
of the same. Only a glimpse, for as he started, wondering
if it could be a figment of his own imagination, the
face suddenly vanished into the shadow, and the figure
glided from the room. Still it haunted him; could there
have been a real resemblance? or was it only a hallucination
of his own?</p>
<p>About an hour later, Houston, who had observed his
uncle&rsquo;s involuntary start of surprise on seeing Lyle, and
who was anxious that he should learn the truth as early
as possible, slipping his arm within that of his uncle&rsquo;s,
led him out upon the porch, where they lighted their
cigars, smoking for a few moments in silence, then talking
together in low tones of the one so dear to each of
them, while Houston related the details of his first meeting
and early acquaintance with the miner, Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if Guy cannot recover,&rdquo; said Mr. Cameron, in
tremulous tones, when Houston had finished, &ldquo;Yet if he
lives long enough to see and recognize his mother and
myself, and realize our feeling for him&ndash;&ndash;even then, I shall
be more than repaid for your coming out here,&ndash;&ndash;though
all else were lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you would,&rdquo; responded Houston, &ldquo;but I cannot
help feeling that Guy&rsquo;s life will be spared, that he will
live to bless your future years. But my dear uncle,&rdquo; he
continued, very slowly, &ldquo;although you are yet unaware
of it, you have nearly as much, if not an equal cause for
joy in another direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, Everard; you surely do not
allude to the property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, very far from that; did you notice the young girl
who came into Guy&rsquo;s room to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bring the light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I intended to inquire of you concerning her.
Her face impressed me strangely; I cannot tell whether
it was a fact or my own imagination, but I had been
thinking of the children,&ndash;&ndash;Guy and his sister,&ndash;&ndash;as they
were years ago, and it seemed to me that her face, as I
saw it for an instant, was almost an exact counterpart of
my own Edna&rsquo;s, as she used to look, even to the hair and
eyes which were very peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was no imagination on your part, the resemblance
is very marked, not only in face, but in voice and manner
as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Cameron
quickly, &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the one who, of all the world, would have the
best right to resemble your daughter,&rdquo; replied Houston;
then, in answer to Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s look of perplexed inquiry,
he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, uncle, for any painful allusion, but at the
time of my cousin&rsquo;s death, I believe you had no direct
proof as to the fate of her child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No absolute proof, of course,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cameron,
&ldquo;only the testimony of those who identified the mother,
that there was no child with her, and no child among any
of those saved answering to the description given, from
which we naturally supposed the little one to have been
killed outright. Why, Everard,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as a new
thought occurred to him, &ldquo;you certainly do not think this
Edna&rsquo;s child, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why might it not be possible?&rdquo; inquired Houston,
wishing to lead his uncle gradually up to the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this her home?&rdquo; asked Mr. Cameron in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Houston, &ldquo;this has been her home, I believe,
for the last ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the supposition mentioned a moment ago were correct,
how would she be here, amid such surroundings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the man who runs this house?&rdquo; Houston
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man by the name of Maverick had charge of it
when I was out here years ago; I do not know whether
he is still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is; do you know him? Did you ever have any
business with him personally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had him in my employ years ago, in the east,
and was obliged to discharge him for dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereby incurring his life-long hatred and enmity, so
that years afterward, he sought to wreak his revenge upon
you by stealing from the wrecked train, where your
daughter lost her life, the little child who would otherwise
have been your solace in that time of bereavement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cameron, &ldquo;are you sure
you are correct? What proof have you of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proofs were not discovered until recently,&rdquo;
Houston replied, &ldquo;although we knew that they existed,
but now this girl has found a letter from Maverick&rsquo;s
wife confessing the whole crime, and stating that it was
committed through a spirit of revenge; and she also has
in her possession the articles of clothing she wore at the
time she was stolen, together with a locket containing
her mother&rsquo;s picture and her own name,&ndash;&ndash;Marjorie Lyle
Washburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Cameron briefly, &ldquo;let me
see her, Everard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston stepped within the house, reappearing a few
moments later, with Lyle. Very beautiful she looked
as she came forward in the soft radiance of the moonlight,
a child-like confidence shining in the lovely eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron rose to meet her, and taking both her
hands within his own, he stood for an instant, gazing into
the beautiful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, my own Edna!&rdquo; he said in broken
tones, folding her closely within his arms, &ldquo;Thank God
for another child restored to us from the dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston returned to the sick-room, leaving Mr. Cameron
and Lyle in their new-found joy. Lyle told him
briefly the story of her life, his eyes growing stern with
indignation as he listened to the wrongs she had endured,
then luminous with tenderness, as she told of Jack&rsquo;s affectionate
care for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me &lsquo;papa&rsquo; my child, as you used to in the days of
your babyhood,&rdquo; he said, kissing her, as they rose to return
to Guy&rsquo;s room, &ldquo;you never even then, would call
Mrs. Cameron or myself anything but &lsquo;mamma&rsquo; and
&lsquo;papa,&rsquo; and now you shall be as our own child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they watched beside the sick-bed until the
morning sun touched the mountain peaks with glory, but
there came no relief to the sufferer, now moaning and
tossing in delirium.</p>
<p>Eastward, across the mountain ranges, Morton Rutherford
was speeding swiftly, scarcely heeding in his sorrow
and anxiety, the grandeur and beauty through which
he was passing; while from Chicago, the sweet-faced
mother was hastening westward, all unconscious that she
was being swiftly and surely borne to the answer of her
prayers,&ndash;&ndash;that in that distant western country to which
she was journeying, her son lay calling her in his fever
and delirium.</p>
<p>She had started in response to a dispatch from Morton
Rutherford, at Silver City:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cameron and Everard Houston safe and well, but wish
you to come out immediately. Wire where I will meet you in
St. Paul. Will explain when I see you.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Morton Rutherford.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mining camp that morning, presented a strange
scene of idleness and desolation. Many of the mines
were in ruins, while the remainder were shut down.</p>
<p>They would remain shut down for an indefinite period,
Houston told the men who had gathered about the house
for information. The officers of the company, he further
stated, had been arrested and their property would
soon be seized, hence it would be impossible to state
when the mines would be reopened. It was probable
that with the next spring, an entirely new corporation
would be organized, and the mining and milling plant
rebuilt, and operated on a much more extensive scale
than before; and should this be the case, he would then
and there vouch that those of his men who had proven
themselves trustworthy and honorable, would be certain
of work, should they desire it, in the newly opened mines.</p>
<p>The men knew of Jack&rsquo;s condition, and while not a
sound was made that would disturb the sufferer, the better
class swung their hats high in the air, in token of applause,
and then walked silently away.</p>
<p>It was found in the succeeding days that several
miners had lost their lives in the explosions of the Yankee
Boy mine; a few were so far underground that their doom
was inevitable, while others, whom Houston had warned,
instead of following his instructions, had endeavored to
escape through the shafts, and had discovered too late
that they had only rushed on to certain death.</p>
<p>Maverick, the tool by which all this destruction had
been wrought, after his deadly work was done, overcome
by his wretched cowardice, remained concealed until a
late hour; then creeping from his hiding place to gloat
over the havoc and ruin he had wrought, he suddenly
found his triumph was short. Under the shelter of a few
boards, temporarily erected, he found the ghastly remains
of his companion and director in crime. Shivering and
trembling with fear, he crept up the road till within sight
of the house, arriving just in time to see Houston,&ndash;&ndash;whom
he supposed crushed and buried within the mine,&ndash;&ndash;presenting
Lyle to Mr. Cameron. He lingered long
enough to see her clasped in his arms, then skulked back
into the shadow, retreating down the road, gnashing his
teeth with rage and disappointment. The following day
search was made for him, under instructions from Mr.
Cameron and Houston, who offered a large reward for
him, living or dead. His body was found in an old,
abandoned shaft on the mountain side, riddled with bullets.
The vengeance of the miners, desperate from the
loss of homes and employment, had overtaken him first.
He was buried hastily and with little ceremony, his two
sons having already taken themselves to parts unknown,
fearful lest the penalty of their father&rsquo;s crimes might be
inflicted upon them, and his fate become theirs also. A
day or two later, Mrs. Maverick, who had been prostrated
by the shock of the explosions and the succeeding
events, died from a sudden paralysis, her feeble mind having
first been cheered and soothed by the assurance from
Mr. Cameron of his forgiveness for the small share which
she had taken in the withholding Lyle from her true
friends and home. She was given a decent burial in the
miners&rsquo; little cemetery at the Y, and the house which for
so many years had been called by their name, knew the
Mavericks no more.</p>
<p>Kind hands laid little Bull-dog under the murmuring
pines on the mountain side, near Morgan&rsquo;s last resting
place, but in the hearts, of Houston and his friends, his
memory could never grow dim.</p>
<p>The small community of miners suddenly vanished,
the deserted quarters, with their blackened ruins, seeming
little like the busy camp of but a few days before, resounding
with their songs and jests.</p>
<p>Only in the house nestling at the foot of the mountain
there were no signs of desertion. It was crowded to
overflowing, and within its walls, during those next succeeding
days, what combats were waged, between hope
and fear, joy and despair, life and death!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>
</div>
<p>Five days had passed, days of raging fever and delirium
so violent that already the powerful frame seemed nearly
exhausted; the sufferer calling almost incessantly for the
loved ones of his old home, but oftenest for his mother.
Some faint glimmer of recognition must occasionally
have reached those darkened chambers of the brain, since
when attended by Mr. Cameron, Houston or Lyle, he
rested more quietly, though never calling Lyle by her
own name, but always by that of his sister, Edna.</p>
<p>The fever had subsided, and he was now rapidly passing
into a death-like stupor, hovering between life and
death, unconscious of skilled physicians and trained
nurses that came and went, unconscious of loving friends
bending above him, their prayers and efforts combined
with the skill of the former, in the terrible combat against
the mighty foe.</p>
<p>The physicians watching by the bedside, shook their
heads, as they felt the pulse, fluttering more and more
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sinking, failing rapidly,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to-night
will be the crisis, the turning point; unless there is a
change then for the better, he will never see the dawning
of another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Mrs. Cameron, journeying westward with Morton
Rutherford, the moments had seemed like hours, the
hours like days, since learning for whose sake had come
the summons to that distant country. Only the speed
of the lightning could have satisfied the heart of the
mother hastening to her long-lost son.</p>
<p>They had been kept informed along the route of Guy&rsquo;s
condition, and now, upon their arrival at Silver City, on
the noon train, they found a special car awaiting them,
to convey them at once to the Y, which had been ordered
by telegraphic dispatch from Mr. Cameron.</p>
<p>The watchers by the bedside heard the sound of swiftly
approaching wheels; Mr. Cameron and Houston stepped
quickly out to greet the sweet-faced woman hastening
toward the house on the arm of Morton Rutherford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I in time? Is our boy still living?&rdquo; were her first
words, as her husband met her with outstretched arms,
his face working with deep emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time, thank God!&rdquo; was the broken reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Walter, is there no hope?&rdquo; she queried, understanding
his words only too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not deceive you, Marjorie, there is the barest
possibility that he may live, no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must live, and he will,&rdquo; replied the mother, in
tones that reminded both Houston and Morton Rutherford
wonderfully of Lyle.</p>
<p>Turning toward Houston, Mrs. Cameron greeted him
affectionately, and gently touching the wounded arm, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, dear boy, what a terrible risk you have
run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which he replied, &ldquo;I would go through it all again,
Aunt Marjorie, for the joy I believe it will bring you and
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, Mr. Cameron led his wife into
the sick-room. Lyle had already left the room, and there
remained only Leslie Gladden, sitting quietly near the foot
of the bed, and the nurse, who respectfully withdrew
from his place beside the patient, as Mrs. Cameron approached.</p>
<p>Calmly, though through fast-falling tears, the mother
gazed for a moment upon her son; then dropping upon
her knees beside the bed, she slipped one arm underneath
the pillows, and gently drew the wounded head upon her
own breast, tenderly kissing the brow and cheeks; then
taking his hand within her own, she stroked and caressed
it, meanwhile crooning over him in low, murmuring
tones, as though he had been an infant.</p>
<p>There were no dry eyes in that little room, not excepting
even the nurse, while from the door-way of the adjoining
room, Morton Rutherford, Lyle and Everard
Houston watched the scene with hearts too full for utterance.
Something in that gentle touch must have carried
the troubled mind of the sufferer back to the days
of his childhood; gradually the faint moaning ceased, the
drawn, tense features relaxed, and a sweet, child-like
smile stole over his face now assuming a death-like pallor.</p>
<p>For hours the mother knelt there, her husband by her
side, Everard and Leslie standing near, while in the background,
in the dim light, was Lyle with Morton Rutherford.</p>
<p>At last, Mr. Cameron, bending over his wife, entreated
her to take a few moments&rsquo; rest and a little food. She hesitated,
but Everard spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take some refreshment, Aunt Marjorie,
you have had no food for hours; Leslie and I will watch
here, and if there should be the slightest change, I will
call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the name of Leslie, Mrs. Cameron looked up, with
a sweet, motherly smile, into the beautiful but tear-stained
face beside her, and gently withdrawing from the bedside,
she turned and clasped Miss Gladden in her arms,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Leslie, I did not think we would meet for
the first time under such circumstances as these, but I am
more than glad to find you here. Everard has always
been, and still is as our own son, and I welcome you, my
dear, as a daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On entering the dining-room, Mr. and Mrs. Cameron
found a most tempting luncheon prepared for them, but
no one in the room, Lyle having judged they would prefer
to be by themselves for awhile.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Cameron, having partaken of some slight refreshment,
was preparing to return to the sick-room, her
husband said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, my dear; there is another joy in store
for you, Marjorie, in that, through Everard&rsquo;s coming out
into this country, we have received back from the dead,
as it were, not only our son, but also a daughter. I
want you to meet her now, my dear, so prepare yourself
for a great surprise, and perhaps, something of a shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cameron,
looking bewildered, &ldquo;you certainly do not refer to
Leslie, I have met her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my love, Leslie is a beautiful girl, and will be to
us a lovely daughter, but I refer to a daughter of our own
flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping to an adjoining room, Mr. Cameron called
in a low tone, &ldquo;Lyle, my dear,&rdquo; returning immediately to
his wife&rsquo;s side to support her in case the shock should
prove too much in her present agitated condition.</p>
<p>Lyle glided into the room, slowly approaching Mrs.
Cameron, who sat speechless, pale as death, but controlling
herself by a visible effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edna, my child! my own Edna!&rdquo; she cried, rising
with outstretched arms, and clasping Lyle to her breast;
then turning toward her husband, she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean, Walter? Can this be Edna&rsquo;s
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my love,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this is the little Marjorie
we have mourned as dead for so many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while they sat clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms, their
tears commingling, while Mr. Cameron briefly explained
to his wife the main facts in Lyle&rsquo;s strange history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall be our own daughter, shall she not, Walter?
She shall be to us just what Edna was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the response, &ldquo;she is our own daughter,
Marjorie Lyle Cameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to Guy&rsquo;s room, Mrs. Cameron resuming
her old place, with Guy&rsquo;s head upon her breast, his
hand in hers, only that now Lyle knelt beside her. At
their side, and very near his son, was Mr. Cameron, while
just back of them were Everard, Leslie and Morton Rutherford.
Ned Rutherford and Van Dorn lingered in the
door-way watching, while at the foot of the bed stood
Mike, the tears coursing down his rugged face. On the
other side of the bed stood the physicians and nurse,
their keen eyes watching the subtle changes passing over
the face, now white as marble, and almost as motionless.</p>
<p>Fainter and shorter grew the gasping breaths, more
and more feeble the pulse, until at last it was evident to
every one within that little room, that life had very nearly
ebbed away.</p>
<p>But there was one who did not, for one instant, lose
faith or hope. The sublime faith which had upheld her
through all those years of a sorrow greater than death,
did not desert her now. Lyle seemed to share her faith,
and they alone remained calm and tearless, the saint-like
face of the mother shining with love and trust.</p>
<p>Suddenly, upon that death-like stillness, her voice rang
out, with startling clearness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guy! oh, Guy, my darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to that soul, slipping through the fast-darkening
shadows, almost within the grasp of the great enemy,
there seemed to have come some echo of those tones, with
their piercing sweetness, recalling him to life; for, with a
long, quivering breath, Guy slowly opened his eyes, gazing,
for an instant, with a dreamy smile, upon the faces
surrounding him. His eyes closed with a gentle sigh,
but while those about him anxiously awaited the next
breath, they again opened, full of the light of recognition,
while a rapturous smile grew and deepened upon his face,
irradiating his features with joy, his lips moving in a
whisper so faint that only the mother&rsquo;s ear could catch
the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&ndash;&ndash;it was&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;a dream,&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;is true,&rdquo;
then, exhausted, he sank into a deep sleep like a child&rsquo;s,
his breathing growing more and more regular and natural,
moment by moment.</p>
<p>The physicians withdrew from the bedside, their vigil
was over; &ldquo;He will live,&rdquo; they said briefly, while in response,
there rose from all parts of the room, deep sobs
of joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>
</div>
<p>For the first week or two, Guy Cameron&rsquo;s recovery was
slow, but at the expiration of that time his vigorous constitution
reasserted itself, and he gained rapidly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Silver City, affairs were progressing under
the efficient management of Mr. Whitney, the clear-headed
attorney from New York.</p>
<p>When orders for arrest were first issued, it was soon
discovered that the office of the North Western Mining,
Land &amp; Investment Company was practically deserted.
None of their books or papers were to be found, their
clerks had been dismissed, and no trace existed of the
officers of the company. No information regarding their
whereabouts could be obtained from any of the officers of
the several high-titled companies occupying the same
room, as they were supremely and serenely unconscious
that anything out of the usual order had occurred, and
full of regrets that they were unable to furnish the desired
information.</p>
<p>Blaisdell was discovered the following day, in company
with his eldest son, in an old abandoned mine about two
miles from town, which he claimed they were working,
his limited means not allowing him to wander far from
the scene of his crimes. He was brought back to town
and held pending the discovery of Wilson and Rivers,
for whom detectives were searching in every direction.
The former was never found, but at the end of about two
weeks, the latter was run to earth in an eastern city, where
he was masquerading in snow-white wig and beard and
colored eye-glasses, as a retired and invalid clergyman,
living in great seclusion.</p>
<p>Blaisdell and Rivers were tried on the charge of murder,
the most important witnesses for the prosecution being
Everard Houston and Morton Rutherford; the latter
testifying as to the nature of the final and fatal dispatch
sent on that eventful day, in which he was corroborated
by the telegraph operator of the Silver City office, who
had been found and secured as a witness, and who verified
Rutherford&rsquo;s statements regarding the message, but
at the same time cleared Mr. Blaisdell from all connection
therewith; the message having been sent by Rivers
in Blaisdell&rsquo;s absence, whether with his knowledge and
consent, they were unable to ascertain. The charge
against Blaisdell was therefore dismissed through lack of
evidence, while in Rivers&rsquo; case, a verdict was returned for
manslaughter, and he was given the extreme limit of the
law, imprisonment for ten years.</p>
<p>Blaisdell was then speedily arraigned for a new trial
on the charge of embezzlement, the date on which his
case was set for hearing being the same as that upon
which his partner in crime was to be transferred to the
state penitentiary.</p>
<p>On that morning, however, the guard on going to the
cell occupied by Rivers, found him just expiring, having
succeeded in smuggling into his cell a quantity of
morphine, how or when, no one could ascertain. He left
a letter in which he stated that no state penitentiary had
ever held him, or ever would, but that &ldquo;as the game was
up&rdquo; he would give them a few particulars regarding his
past life. He gave his true name, the name of a man who,
twenty-five years before, had been wanted in the state
of New York for a heavy bank robbery and murder. For
years, under an alias, he had belonged to a gang of counterfeiters
in Missouri, but upon the discovery and arrest
of the leaders of the band, he had assumed his present
alias and had come west.</p>
<p>As Blaisdell took his place that morning in the prisoner&rsquo;s
box, he was a pitiable object. Haunted almost to
madness by the awful fate of his associate, confronted by
an overwhelming array of evidence, furnished by Houston,
Van Dorn and Lindlay, including also a deposition
of Guy Cameron&rsquo;s, taken in his sick-room, his own abject
and hopeless appearance bore the most damaging testimony
against him. His case was quickly decided, his
sentence being for seven years.</p>
<p>After the trial, Morton Rutherford and Van Dorn returned
at once to the camp, and a day or two later, when
business affairs had at last been satisfactorily adjusted,
Mr. Cameron and Houston returned, bringing with them
Mr. Whitney and Lindlay, for a visit of a week among the
mountains, before the entire party should return east.</p>
<p>It was now early in the fall. Already the nights were
frosty, but the days were royal as only early autumnal
days among the mountains can be. Every breath was
exhilarating, each inhalation seeming laden with some
subtle elixir of life.</p>
<p>Guy Cameron was now convalescent, able to sit with
his friends in the low, rustic porch, or even to join them
in short strolls among the rocks by the lake.</p>
<p>One afternoon they all sat in and about the porch, in
the soft, hazy sunlight, the vines and shrubbery about
them brilliant in their autumnal tints of crimson and
orange and gold. The group was complete, with the exception
of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Whitney, who still lingered
within doors, engaged in drawing up some papers
of which no one seemed to understand the import, excepting
Houston, who had just left the gentlemen to join
the group outside.</p>
<p>It was a strikingly beautiful picture; Mrs. Cameron
seated in the center, with her sweet face and snow-white
hair, and on either side a lovely daughter. Near Lyle
were seated Guy Cameron and Morton Rutherford,&ndash;&ndash;between
whom there already existed a deep affinity,&ndash;&ndash;-with
their faces of remarkable strength and beauty. On
the grass, just outside the porch, in various easy attitudes,
were Ned Rutherford, Van Dorn and Lindlay, and
it was noticeable that under the influence of late events,
even Ned&rsquo;s boyish face was gradually assuming a far
more mature and thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>As Houston seated himself beside Leslie, both she and
Lyle observed that his face was lighted with a smile of
deep satisfaction, but he remained silent, and the conversation
continued as before, the members of the little
group engaged in anticipations of their return to their
respective homes, and in comments upon this particular
portion of the west with which they had become familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will you love best, Jack, my dear,&rdquo; Lyle asked
of Guy in low tones, using the old form of address still
very dear to her, &ldquo;the eastern home, or the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old home was never so dear to me as now,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;but I am deeply attached to the mountains; for
years they were my only friends, and I shall wish to look
upon them occasionally in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ned Rutherford was saying, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
thought it, but I&rsquo;ve got so attached to this place out here,
I&rsquo;d like an excuse of some sort,&ndash;&ndash;some kind of business,
you know,&ndash;&ndash;that would bring me here part of the time;
what do you think, Mort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our associations here have had a great deal to
do with the attractions of the place, but as a quiet retreat
in which to spend a few weeks of each summer, I can
not imagine a more delightful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everard, of what are you thinking so deeply?&rdquo; demanded
Lyle, watching his thoughtful face, &ldquo;you have
not spoken a word since you came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of the evening when first we had Mr.
Lindlay and Mr. Van Dorn as guests in this house; thinking
of the contrast between then and now; that was
ushering in the close of the old regime, and this is the
eve of the new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will the mines be reopened?&rdquo; inquired Van
Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as possible after the rebuilding of the
plant, next spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these mines will be owned and controlled by the
New York company, will they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they will probably purchase other good
properties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, but that will make a fine plant, out
&rsquo;ere!&rdquo; exclaimed Lindlay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; responded Van Dorn.</p>
<p>Just at that instant, Mr. Cameron and Mr. Whitney appeared,
the latter carrying a large roll of legal cap, covered
with his well-known hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Cameron, seating himself beside
his wife and a little in the rear of the remainder of the
group, &ldquo;Mr. Whitney and myself have been engaged in
drawing up the articles of incorporation of the new mining
company to be organized out here very shortly, and I
thought perhaps you and the young people would be interested
in them. I want to say that they are drawn up
subject to the approval of all parties interested, and after
you have heard them read, we want you to express your
opinions, jointly and severally. Mr. Whitney, as I believe
you are the only one who would be able to read
those cabalistic signs, we will now listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid a general laugh at Mr. Whitney&rsquo;s expense, he began
the reading of the articles of incorporation. The
first article, setting forth the object of the corporation,
was read, and by the time Mr. Whitney had reached the
second, the members of the party were all attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Article II. This corporation shall be known as The
Rocky Mountain Mining Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of approval ran through the little group,
and the sonorous tones continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Article III. The officers of the company hereby incorporated
shall be as follows: Walter E. Cameron,
president; Walter E. Houston, vice-president; Guy M.
Cameron, treasurer and general manager; Edward B.
Rutherford, Jr., secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron, from his post of observation, watching
to see the effect produced by the reading of this document,
did not have to wait long. The faces of the ladies
expressed their delight, while Ned Rutherford was
speechless with astonishment; but it was the figure half
reclining in the invalid chair that he watched most
closely; it was his son&rsquo;s approval that he most desired.</p>
<p>At the mention of his name, Guy Cameron had given a
slight start, but he now lay with closed eyes, the only
sign of emotion visible being that his pale face had grown
still paler. Only the preceding day, Guy and his parents
had held their first and only conversation together regarding
the time so long past, Mr. and Mrs. Cameron intending
it to be the first and last allusion which should be
made to that sad time. Guy well knew that all was forgiven;
he knew that the unhappy secret had been guarded
with such loving care that his reputation was untarnished,
there was nothing to be recalled against him on his
return; yet he would consent only to a brief visit to the old
home; he would not yet return permanently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me first go into business somewhere, and retrieve
myself in my own eyes at least,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;not be
taken back as a prodigal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron had conferred with Houston, and both
hoped that a responsible position in the newly organized
company, amid the old familiar scenes and work, and associated
with those to whom he had become personally
attached, would more than meet his wishes. Mr. Cameron
had wished to make him general manager on account
of his familiarity with the business, while Houston
wished him to hold the office of treasurer, as token of
their perfect trust; hence the two were combined.</p>
<p>After all the articles of incorporation had been read in
full, the little group broke up, and crowded around the
newly-chosen young officers with many congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; ejaculated Ned, &ldquo;I never was so thunder
struck in my life! Accept it? well, I should say so,
Mr. Cameron, and with many thanks; you couldn&rsquo;t have
picked out anything that would suit me better. I guess,&rdquo;
he added in a confidential aside to Houston, &ldquo;I guess that
will fix the old fellow down there in Boston all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy grasped his father&rsquo;s hand and Houston&rsquo;s in a manner
that removed every anxiety from their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than satisfactory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;more than I
could wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following day, Mr. Whitney, Lindlay and Van
Dorn returned east, leaving the &ldquo;family party&rdquo; as they
laughingly styled themselves, to follow later.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant surprises of those last few days of
their stay, it was discovered that Leslie Gladden, whom
Mrs. Cameron and Lyle had urged to make her home
with them upon their return, was the owner of a palatial
residence not many blocks from their own city home, besides
having a snug little fortune in bonds and stocks.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s surprise was unbounded, but remembering
how he had won Leslie&rsquo;s love, there was little he could
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you once said you never had a home of your
own,&rdquo; he remarked in considerable perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied archly, &ldquo;a residence is not necessarily
a home; it has never been a home to me since my
earliest recollection, but it will be one soon, in the truest
sense of the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One morning a few days later, they awoke to find the
mountains about them white with snow, and a light snowfall
in the canyon; and though the latter vanished presently
under the balmy breath of a &ldquo;chinook,&rdquo; it had given
them warning that the winter king was approaching, and
would soon seize the scepter from autumn&rsquo;s hand, to begin
his long reign among the mountains.</p>
<p>That day, the old house which had witnessed such
varied scenes within the past few months, was closed, and
a very joyous party started for Silver City, the initial point
of the long eastward journey, their hearts throbbing with
delight that they were homeward bound.</p>
<p>In the first carriage rode Mr. and Mrs. Cameron and
their newly-found son and daughter, while following so
closely that their merry jokes and song and laughter were
intermingled, were Everard Houston, Leslie Gladden
and the two brothers; and as they passed down the winding
canyon road, casting loving, farewell glances at the
friendly peaks, clad that day in dazzling brightness, and
recalled their first coming to the heart of the Rockies,
they were, one and all, agreed that the end was better
than the beginning.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>According to Houston&rsquo;s prediction, the mines were reopened
the following year, and operated on a far more
extensive scale. On the site of the old mills, an immense
building was erected, thoroughly equipped with the latest
improvements in mining machinery and electrical and
mechanical appliances. The old mines were repaired
and extended and new properties were purchased, giving
employment to hundreds of men. Early in the second
year, a railroad was constructed by the company, extending
up the canyon from the Y, to the camp, for the transportation
of ore, mining supplies, freight and passengers.</p>
<p>As the mines were enlarged and new properties developed,
quite a community sprang up in that vicinity,
which, after the construction of the railroad, speedily developed
into a typical mining town; and now, after a lapse
of three years, few would recognize the old camp.</p>
<p>Half way up the steep grade from the Y, is the smelting
plant of the company, while at the terminus of the
road, are the long, stone storehouses, at one end of which
is the general office and a pleasant reception room. Next
comes the great milling and reduction plant, while just
beyond are the offices of the company, a fine, three-story
brick building. From this building can be seen, in one
direction the extensive mining works, with their labyrinth
of shafts and tunnels, diggings and dumps; while in another
direction are stretched the homes of the miners,
the boarding houses, and, at a little distance, the post-office,
hotel, stores and shops of the little town, as well
as a tasteful church and school house. As one gazes upon
the peaceful picture of the mountain town, there is
nothing to recall the frightful scene of destruction and
ruin of only three years past.</p>
<p>There is little to remind one of former times, until, having
followed the broad, winding road for some distance,
one suddenly comes upon a familiar sight. Nestling at
the foot of the pine-covered mountain, on the site of the
old boarding house, is a beautiful, wide-spreading stone
cottage, so built that its numerous bow-windows take
in a view of the azure lake and shining cascades, as well
as of the surrounding peaks and the sunset sky; and on
the broad, vine-covered veranda, is a well-known group,
who come from their distant, city homes, to spend a few
weeks of each summer amid the grandeur and beauty of
the mountains, to listen to the whispering of the pines
and the music of the cascades.</p>
<p>Morton Rutherford and his bride are here; Lyle, physically
and mentally developed into royal, radiant womanhood,
more beautiful than ever, but to whom there comes
occasionally an irresistible longing to revisit her old
mountain home, for the years of happiness and love have
obliterated all bitter memories of the loveless, joyless
childhood, and only the remembrance of its beauty remains.</p>
<p>By her side, is Guy Cameron, his proud, erect bearing
showing the change which these few years have wrought
in his life; lonely and solitary no longer, for near him is a
queenly woman, who, knowing the sad secret of his past,
will share and brighten his future.</p>
<p>Everard Houston and his lovely wife need no introduction,
but, beside them is a little stranger, possessing Leslie&rsquo;s
wondrous dark eyes, but Houston&rsquo;s features,&ndash;&ndash;another
little Marjorie,&ndash;&ndash;while beside the wee maiden is a
small chevalier, only two months her senior, rejoicing in
the name of Morton Rutherford. In the dignified, business-like
face of the proud father, it is difficult to recognize
the former Ned Rutherford, but while possessing
still the same light-hearted nature, yet the responsibilities
intrusted to him, and the years of constant association
with a man like Everard Houston, have developed a business
ability surprising even to himself. As secretary of
the Rocky Mountain Mining Company, he has proved to
be the right man in the right place, thereby reflecting
much credit upon Houston&rsquo;s insight and good judgment
in selecting him for the position. By his side is a fair
woman, the &ldquo;Grace&rdquo; of whom he used to dream when
first he visited the mountains.</p>
<p>Strolling up and down the graveled walks, in consultation
regarding the mines, are two figures, one of whom
is easily recognized as Arthur Van Dorn, mining expert
for the company, and superintendent of the milling and
reduction plant. The energetic, business man by his
side is M. T. Donovan, superintendent of the entire mining
plant, but a second glance is necessary to recognize
in him, Mike, the old-time miner, and the faithful friend
of Guy Cameron in his years of loneliness. Donovan
and Van Dorn present a striking contrast, but they are
good friends, and the latter&rsquo;s personation of the former,
on a certain occasion, is a standing joke between them.</p>
<p>There is one more familiar figure, not to be omitted,
and that is Rex, stretched on the soft grass in an attitude
of perfect content, his nose resting on his paws, his eyes
fixed on his master&rsquo;s face with the old-time devotion.</p>
<p>Beautiful as this picture may be, it is not quite complete
without a glimpse of a far-away, eastern home, where, in
the gloaming, beside an open grate, sit a couple with
peaceful faces, crowned with snow-white hair. They
have passed the grand summit of middle age, with its
broad horizons, where hope and ambition are at their
zenith, and together are journeying down the long, gentle
declivity; but the clouds of loss and bereavement and
pain that gathered about their path in the years gone by,
have passed, and the valley before them is flooded with
golden light. Their home circle, once broken, is now
nearly complete; the once vacant places by the fireside
are again filled, and the old home, silent for so many
years, again resounds with song and laughter, and echoes
once more to the music of childish voices and the patter
of little feet.</p>
<p>For hours, they sit talking together of the joys which
the late years have brought them; until the moonlight
steals in through the open windows, reverently touching
their heads with a silvery radiance, at the same time looking
down in silent, shining benediction upon the peaceful
scene in the heart of the Rockies.</p>
